# Blasteroid

## Concept description

I created a programming project involving a tangible controller integrated with Arduino. 
The project is a game called Blasteroid, where players take on the role of defending Earth from a geomagnetic storm that has caused asteroids to be redirected towards our planet. In this game, players must use their skills to shoot and destroy the asteroids before they impact Earth.

I developed two versions of the game: one that uses an API and one that doesn't. The version with the API utilizes NASAâ€™s database to gather real-time data on asteroid diameters, which are then converted into the corresponding asteroid sizes within the game. This added dynamic element gives players a sense of connection to actual astronomical events. The version without the API uses random values for the asteroid sizes.

The entire game was developed using Java's Canvas feature, without relying on any pre-made images.

The tangible controller, built with Arduino, allows players to interact with the game through physical movements (potentiometer + button)
