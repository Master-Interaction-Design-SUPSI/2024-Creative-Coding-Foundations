<h2>The Famous Oz Books</h2>
<p>Since 1900, when L. Frank Baum introduced to the children of
America THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ and all the other
exciting characters who inhabit the land of Oz, these delightful fairy
tales have stimulated the imagination of millions of young readers.</p>
<p>These are stories which are genuine fantasy—creative, funny,
tender, exciting and surprising. Filled with the rarest and most
absurd creatures, each of the 40 volumes which now comprise the
series, has been eagerly sought out by generation after generation
until today they are known to all except the very young or those
who were never young at all.</p>
<p>When, in a recent survey, The New York Times polled a group of
teen agers on the books they liked best when they were young, the
Oz books topped the list.</p>

<h3>TO MY READERS</h3>
<p>Curiously enough, in the events which have taken
place in the last few years in our “great outside
world,” we may find incidents so marvelous and inspiring
that I cannot hope to equal them with stories of
The Land of Oz.</p>
<p>However, “The Magic of Oz” is really more strange
and unusual than anything I have read or heard about
on our side of The Great Sandy Desert which shuts
us off from The Land of Oz, even during the past
exciting years, so I hope it will appeal to your love of
novelty.</p>
<p>A long and confining illness has prevented my
answering all the good letters sent me—unless stamps
were enclosed—but from now on I hope to be able
to give prompt attention to each and every letter with
which my readers favor me.</p>
<p>Assuring you that my love for you has never faltered
and hoping the Oz Books will continue to give
you pleasure as long as I am able to write them, I am
<span class="center">Yours affectionately,</span>

</div>
<p class="center">CHAPTER 1</p>
<p>On the east edge of the Land
of Oz, in the Munchkin Country,
is a big, tall hill called
Mount Munch. On one side,
the bottom of this hill just
touches the Deadly Sandy
Desert that separates the
Fairyland of Oz from all the
rest of the world, but on the
other side, the hill touches
the beautiful, fertile Country
of the Munchkins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The Munchkin folks, however,
merely stand off and look at Mount Munch and
know very little about it; for, about a third of the
way up, its sides become too steep to climb, and if
any people live upon the top of that great towering
peak that seems to reach nearly to the skies, the
Munchkins are not aware of the fact.</p>
<p>But people <i>do</i> live there, just the same. The top
of Mount Munch is shaped like a saucer, broad and
deep, and in the saucer are fields where grains and
vegetables grow, and flocks are fed, and brooks flow
and trees bear all sorts of things. There are houses
scattered here and there, each having its family of
Hyups, as the people call themselves. The Hyups
seldom go down the mountain, for the same reason
that the Munchkins never climb up: the sides are too
steep.</p>
<p>In one of the houses lived a wise old Hyup named
Bini Aru, who used to be a clever Sorcerer. But
Ozma of Oz, who rules everyone in the Land of Oz,
had made a decree that no one should practice magic
in her dominions except Glinda the Good and the
Wizard of Oz, and when Glinda sent this royal command
to the Hyups by means of a strong-winged
Eagle, old Bini Aru at once stopped performing
magical arts. He destroyed many of his magic powders
and tools of magic, and afterward honestly
obeyed the law. He had never seen Ozma, but he
knew she was his Ruler and must be obeyed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>There was only one thing that grieved him. He
had discovered a new and secret method of transformations
that was unknown to any other Sorcerer.
Glinda the Good did not know it, nor did the little
Wizard of Oz, nor Dr. Pipt nor old Mombi, nor anyone
else who dealt in magic arts. It was Bini Aru’s
own secret. By its means, it was the simplest thing
in the world to transform anyone into beast, bird or
fish, or anything else, and back again, once you knew
how to pronounce the mystical word: “<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>.”</p>
<p>Bini Aru had used this secret many times, but not
to cause evil or suffering to others. When he had
wandered far from home and was hungry, he would
say: “I want to become a cow—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!” In
an instant he would be a cow, and then he would eat
grass and satisfy his hunger. All beasts and birds
can talk in the Land of Oz, so when the cow was no
longer hungry, it would say: “I want to be Bini
Aru again: <span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!” and the magic word,
properly pronounced, would instantly restore him to
his proper form.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Now, of course, I would not dare to write down
this magic word so plainly if I thought my readers
would pronounce it properly and so be able to transform
themselves and others, but it is a fact that no
one in all the world except Bini Aru, had ever (up
to the time this story begins) been able to pronounce
“<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>” the right way, so I think it is safe
to give it to you. It might be well, however, in reading
this story aloud, to be careful not to pronounce
<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span> the proper way, and thus avoid all danger
of the secret being able to work mischief.</p>
<p>Bini Aru, having discovered the secret of instant
transformation, which required no tools or powders
or other chemicals or herbs and always worked perfectly,
was reluctant to have such a wonderful discovery
entirely unknown or lost to all human knowledge.
He decided not to use it again, since Ozma
had forbidden him to do so, but he reflected that
Ozma was a girl and some time might change her
mind and allow her subjects to practice magic, in
which case Bini Aru could again transform himself
and others at will,—unless, of course, he forgot how
to pronounce <span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span> in the meantime.</p>
<p>After giving the matter careful thought, he decided
to write the word, and how it should be pronounced,
in some secret place, so that he could find it after
many years, but where no one else could ever find it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>That was a clever idea, but what bothered the old
Sorcerer was to find a secret place. He wandered
all over the Saucer at the top of Mount Munch, but
found no place in which to write the secret word
where others might not be likely to stumble upon it.
So finally he decided it must be written somewhere
in his own house.</p>
<p>Bini Aru had a wife named Mopsi Aru who was
famous for making fine huckleberry pies, and he
had a son named Kiki Aru who was not famous at
all. He was noted as being cross and disagreeable
because he was not happy, and he was not happy
because he wanted to go down the mountain and
visit the big world below and his father would not
let him. No one paid any attention to Kiki Aru,
because he didn’t amount to anything, anyway.</p>
<p>Once a year there was a festival on Mount Munch
which all the Hyups attended. It was held in the
center of the saucer-shaped country, and the day was
given over to feasting and merry-making. The young
folks danced and sang songs; the women spread the
tables with good things to eat, and the men played
on musical instruments and told fairy tales.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Kiki Aru usually went to these festivals with his
parents, and then sat sullenly outside the circle and
would not dance or sing or even talk to the other
young people. So the festival did not make him
any happier than other days, and this time he told
Bini Aru and Mopsi Aru that he would not go. He
would rather stay at home and be unhappy all by
himself, he said, and so they gladly let him stay.</p>
<p>But after he was left alone Kiki decided to enter
his father’s private room, where he was forbidden
to go, and see if he could find any of the magic tools
Bini Aru used to work with when he practiced sorcery.
As he went in Kiki stubbed his toe on one of the floor
boards. He searched everywhere but found no trace
of his father’s magic. All had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Much disappointed, he started to go out again
when he stubbed his toe on the same floor board.
That set him thinking. Examining the board more
closely, Kiki found it had been pried up and then
nailed down again in such a manner that it was a
little higher than the other boards. But why had
his father taken up the board? Had he hidden some
of his magic tools underneath the floor?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="689" src="images/i023.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i023.jpg">
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Kiki got a chisel and pried up the board, but found
nothing under it. He was just about to replace the
board when it slipped from his hand and turned over,
and he saw something written on the underside of it.
The light was rather dim, so he took the board to the
window and examined it, and found that the writing
described exactly how to pronounce the magic word
<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>, which would transform anyone into
anything instantly, and back again when the word
was repeated.</p>
<p>Now, at first, Kiki Aru didn’t realize what a wonderful
secret he had discovered; but he thought it
might be of use to him and so he took a piece of
paper and made on it an exact copy of the instructions
for pronouncing <span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>. Then he folded
the paper and put it in his pocket, and replaced the
board in the floor so that no one would suspect it
had been removed.</p>
<p>After this Kiki went into the garden and sitting
beneath a tree made a careful study of the paper. He
had always wanted to get away from Mount Munch
and visit the big world—especially the Land of Oz—and
the idea now came to him that if he could transform
himself into a bird, he could fly to any place he
wished to go and fly back again whenever he cared to.
It was necessary, however, to learn by heart the way
to pronounce the magic word, because a bird would
have no way to carry a paper with it, and Kiki
would be unable to resume his proper shape if he
forgot the word or its pronunciation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>So he studied it a long time, repeating it a hundred
times in his mind until he was sure he would
not forget it. But to make safety doubly sure he
placed the paper in a tin box in a neglected part of
the garden and covered the box with small stones.</p>
<p>By this time it was getting late in the day and
Kiki wished to attempt his first transformation before
his parents returned from the festival. So he stood
on the front porch of his home and said:</p>
<p>“I want to become a big, strong bird, like a hawk—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!”
He pronounced it the right way,
so in a flash he felt that he was completely changed
in form. He flapped his wings, hopped to the porch
railing and said: “Caw-oo! Caw-oo!”</p>
<p>Then he laughed and said half aloud: “I suppose
that’s the funny sound this sort of a bird makes. But
now let me try my wings and see if I’m strong enough
to fly across the desert.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>For he had decided to make his first trip to the
country outside the Land of Oz. He had stolen this
secret of transformation and he knew he had disobeyed
the law of Oz by working magic. Perhaps
Glinda or the Wizard of Oz would discover him and
punish him, so it would be good policy to keep away
from Oz altogether.</p>
<p>Slowly Kiki rose into the air, and resting on his
broad wings, floated in graceful circles above the
saucer-shaped mountain-top. From his height, he
could see, far across the burning sands of the Deadly
Desert, another country that might be pleasant to
explore, so he headed that way, and with strong,
steady strokes of his wings, began the long flight.</p>

</div>
<p class="center">CHAPTER 2</p>
<p>Even a hawk has to fly high
in order to cross the Deadly
Desert, from which poisonous
fumes are constantly rising.
Kiki Aru felt sick and faint
by the time he reached good
land again, for he could not
quite escape the effects of the
poisons. But the fresh air
soon restored him and he
alighted in a broad table-land
which is called Hiland. Just
beyond it is a valley known
as Loland, and these two countries are ruled by the
Gingerbread Man, John Dough, with Chick the Cherub
as his Prime Minister. The Hawk merely stopped
here long enough to rest, and then he flew north and
passed over a fine country called Merryland, which
is ruled by a lovely Wax Doll. Then, following the
curve of the Desert, he turned north and settled on
a tree-top in the Kingdom of Noland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Kiki was tired by this time, and the sun was now
setting, so he decided to remain here till morning.
From his tree-top he could see a house near by, which
looked very comfortable. A man was milking a cow
in the yard and a pleasant-faced woman came to the
door and called him to supper.</p>
<p>That made Kiki wonder what sort of food hawks
ate. He felt hungry, but didn’t know what to eat
or where to get it. Also he thought a bed would be
more comfortable than a tree-top for sleeping, so
he hopped to the ground and said: “I want to become
Kiki Aru again—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl!</span>”</p>
<p>Instantly he had resumed his natural shape, and
going to the house, he knocked upon the door and
asked for some supper.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” asked the man of the house.</p>
<p>“A stranger from the Land of Oz,” replied Kiki Aru.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>“Then you are welcome,” said the man.</p>
<p>Kiki was given a good supper and a good bed, and
he behaved very well, although he refused to answer
all the questions the good people of Noland asked
him. Having escaped from his home and found a
way to see the world, the young man was no longer
unhappy, and so he was no longer cross and disagreeable.
The people thought him a very respectable
person and gave him breakfast next morning, after
which he started on his way feeling quite contented.</p>
<p>Having walked for an hour or two through the
pretty country that is ruled by King Bud, Kiki Aru
decided he could travel faster and see more as a bird,
so he transformed himself into a white dove and
visited the great city of Nole and saw the King’s
palace and gardens and many other places of interest.
Then he flew westward into the Kingdom of Ix, and
after a day in Queen Zixi’s country went on westward
into the Land of Ev. Every place he visited he
thought was much more pleasant than the saucer-country
of the Hyups, and he decided that when he
reached the finest country of all he would settle there
and enjoy his future life to the utmost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>In the Land of Ev he resumed his own shape again,
for the cities and villages were close together and he
could easily go on foot from one to another of them.</p>
<p>Toward evening he came to a good Inn and asked
the inn-keeper if he could have food and lodging.</p>
<p>“You can if you have the money to pay,” said the
man, “otherwise you must go elsewhere.”</p>
<p>This surprised Kiki, for in the Land of Oz they do
not use money at all, everyone being allowed to take
what he wishes without price. He had no money,
therefore, and so he turned away to seek hospitality
elsewhere. Looking through an open window into
one of the rooms of the Inn, as he passed along, he
saw an old man counting on a table a big heap of gold
pieces, which Kiki thought to be money. One of these
would buy him supper and a bed, he reflected, so he
transformed himself into a magpie and, flying through
the open window, caught up one of the gold pieces
in his beak and flew out again before the old man
could interfere. Indeed, the old man who was robbed
was quite helpless, for he dared not leave his pile of
gold to chase the magpie, and before he could place
the gold in a sack and the sack in his pocket the
robber bird was out of sight and to seek it would be
folly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Kiki Aru flew to a group of trees and, dropping
the gold piece to the ground, resumed his proper
shape, and then picked up the money and put it in
his pocket.</p>
<p>“You’ll be sorry for this!” exclaimed a small voice
just over his head.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="339" src="images/i031.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i031.jpg">
</div>
<p>Kiki looked up and saw that a sparrow, perched
upon a branch, was watching him.</p>
<p>“Sorry for what?” he demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>“Oh, I saw the whole thing,” asserted the sparrow.
“I saw you look in the window at the gold, and then
make yourself into a magpie and rob the poor man,
and then I saw you fly here and make the bird into
your former shape. That’s magic, and magic is wicked
and unlawful; and you stole money, and that’s a still
greater crime. You’ll be sorry, some day.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="321" src="images/i032.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i032.jpg">
</div>
<p>“I don’t care,” replied Kiki Aru, scowling.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid to be wicked?” asked the
sparrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>“No, I didn’t know I was being wicked,” said Kiki,
“but if I was, I’m glad of it. I hate good people.
I’ve always wanted to be wicked, but I didn’t know
how.”</p>
<p>“Haw, haw, haw!” laughed someone behind him,
in a big voice; “that’s the proper spirit, my lad! I’m
glad I’ve met you; shake hands.”</p>
<p>The sparrow gave a frightened squeak and flew
away.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER 3</p>
<p>Kiki turned around and saw
a queer old man standing
near. He didn’t stand
straight, for he was crooked.
He had a fat body and thin
legs and arms. He had a big,
round face with bushy, white
whiskers that came to a point
below his waist, and white
hair that came to a point on
top of his head. He wore
dull-gray clothes that were
tight fitting, and his pockets
were all bunched out as if stuffed full of something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>“I didn’t know you were here,” said Kiki.</p>
<p>“I didn’t come until after you did,” said the queer
old man.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” asked Kiki.</p>
<p>“My name’s Ruggedo. I used to be the Nome
King; but I got kicked out of my country, and now
I’m a wanderer.”</p>
<p>“What made them kick you out?” inquired the
Hyup boy.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s the fashion to kick kings nowadays. I
was a pretty good King—to myself—but those
dreadful Oz people wouldn’t let me alone. So I had
to abdicate.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“It means to be kicked out. But let’s talk about
something pleasant. Who are you and where did
you come from?”</p>
<p>“I’m called Kiki Aru. I used to live on Mount
Munch in the Land of Oz, but now I’m a wanderer
like yourself.”</p>
<p>The Nome King gave him a shrewd look.</p>
<p>“I heard that bird say that you transformed yourself
into a magpie and back again. Is that true?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Kiki hesitated, but saw no reason to deny it. He
felt that it would make him appear more important.</p>
<p>“Well—yes,” he said.</p>
<p>“Then you’re a wizard?”</p>
<p>“No; I only understand transformations,” he
admitted.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s pretty good magic, anyhow,” declared
old Ruggedo. “I used to have some very fine magic,
myself, but my enemies took it all away from me.
Where are you going now?”</p>
<p>“I’m going into the inn, to get some supper and
a bed,” said Kiki.</p>
<p>“Have you the money to pay for it?” asked the
Nome.</p>
<p>“I have one gold piece.”</p>
<p>“Which you stole. Very good. And you’re glad
that you’re wicked. Better yet. I like you, young
man, and I’ll go to the inn with you if you’ll promise
not to eat eggs for supper.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you like eggs?” asked Kiki.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid of ’em; they’re dangerous!” said Ruggedo,
with a shudder.</p>
<p>“All right,” agreed Kiki; “I won’t ask for eggs.”</p>
<p>“Then come along,” said the Nome.</p>
<p>When they entered the inn, the landlord scowled
at Kiki and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>“I told you I would not feed you unless you had
money.”</p>
<p>Kiki showed him the gold piece.</p>
<p>“And how about you?” asked the landlord, turning
to Ruggedo. “Have you money?”</p>
<p>“I’ve something better,” answered the old Nome,
and taking a bag from one of his pockets he poured
from it upon the table a mass of glittering gems—diamonds,
rubies and emeralds.</p>
<p>The landlord was very polite to the strangers after
that. He served them an excellent supper, and while
they ate it, the Hyup boy asked his companion:</p>
<p>“Where did you get so many jewels?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” answered the Nome. “When
those Oz people took my kingdom away from me—just
because it was my kingdom and I wanted to run
it to suit myself—they said I could take as many
precious stones as I could carry. So I had a lot of
pockets made in my clothes and loaded them all up.
Jewels are fine things to have with you when you
travel; you can trade them for anything.”</p>
<p>“Are they better than gold pieces?” asked Kiki.</p>
<p>“The smallest of these jewels is worth a hundred
gold pieces such as you stole from the old
man.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>“Don’t talk so loud,” begged Kiki, uneasily. “Some
one else might hear what you are saying.”</p>
<p>After supper they took a walk together, and the
former Nome King said:</p>
<p>“Do you know the Shaggy Man, and the Scarecrow,
and the Tin Woodman, and Dorothy, and Ozma and
all the other Oz people?”</p>
<p>“No,” replied the boy, “I have never been away
from Mount Munch until I flew over the Deadly
Desert the other day in the shape of a hawk.”</p>
<p>“Then you’ve never seen the Emerald City of Oz?”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said the Nome, “I knew all the Oz people,
and you can guess I do not love them. All during my
wanderings I have brooded on how I can be revenged
on them. Now that I’ve met you I can see a way to
conquer the Land of Oz and be King there myself,
which is better than being King of the Nomes.”</p>
<p>“How can you do that?” inquired Kiki Aru, wonderingly.</p>
<p>“Never mind how. In the first place, I’ll make a
bargain with you. Tell me the secret of how to perform
transformations and I will give you a pocketful
of jewels, the biggest and finest that I possess.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>“No,” said Kiki, who realized that to share his
power with another would be dangerous to himself.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you <i>two</i> pocketsful of jewels,” said the
Nome.</p>
<p>“No;” answered Kiki.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you every jewel I possess.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no!” said Kiki, who was beginning to be
frightened.</p>
<p>“Then,” said the Nome, with a wicked look at the
boy, “I’ll tell the inn-keeper that you stole that gold
piece and he will have you put in prison.”</p>
<p>Kiki laughed at the threat.</p>
<p>“Before he can do that,” said he, “I will transform
myself into a lion and tear him to pieces, or into a
bear and eat him up, or into a fly and fly away where
he could not find me.”</p>
<p>“Can you really do such wonderful transformations?”
asked the old Nome, looking at him curiously.</p>
<p>“Of course,” declared Kiki. “I can transform you
into a stick of wood, in a flash, or into a stone, and
leave you here by the roadside.”</p>
<p>The wicked Nome shivered a little when he heard
that, but it made him long more than ever to possess
the great secret. After a while he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do. If you will help me to
conquer Oz and to transform the Oz people, who are
my enemies, into sticks or stones, by telling me your
secret, I’ll agree to make <i>you</i> the Ruler of all Oz,
and I will be your Prime Minister and see that your
orders are obeyed.”</p>
<p>“I’ll help do that,” said Kiki, “but I won’t tell
you my secret.”</p>
<p>The Nome was so furious at this refusal that he
jumped up and down with rage and spluttered and
choked for a long time before he could control his
passion. But the boy was not at all frightened. He
laughed at the wicked old Nome, which made him
more furious than ever.</p>
<p>“Let’s give up the idea,” he proposed, when Ruggedo
had quieted somewhat. “I don’t know the Oz
people you mention and so they are not my enemies.
If they’ve kicked you out of your kingdom, that’s
your affair—not mine.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t you like to be king of that splendid
fairyland?” asked Ruggedo.</p>
<p>“Yes, I would,” replied Kiki Aru; “but you want
to be king yourself, and we would quarrel over it.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>“No,” said the Nome, trying to deceive him. “I
don’t care to be king of Oz, come to think it over. I
don’t even care to live in that country. What I want
first is revenge. If we can conquer Oz, I’ll get enough
magic then to conquer my own kingdom of the Nomes,
and I’ll go back and live in my underground caverns,
which are more home-like than the top of the earth.
So here’s my proposition: Help me conquer Oz and
get revenge, and help me get the magic away from
Glinda and the Wizard, and I’ll let you be King of
Oz forever afterward.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="345" src="images/i041.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i041.jpg">
</div>
<p>“I’ll think it over,” answered Kiki, and that is all
he would say that evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>In the night when all in the Inn were asleep but
himself, old Ruggedo the Nome, rose softly from his
couch and went into the room of Kiki Aru the Hyup,
and searched everywhere for the magic tool that
performed his transformations. Of course, there was
no such tool, and although Ruggedo searched in all
the boy’s pockets, he found nothing magical whatever.
So he went back to his bed and began to doubt
that Kiki could perform transformations.</p>
<p>Next morning he said:</p>
<p>“Which way do you travel to-day?”</p>
<p>“I think I shall visit the Rose Kingdom,” answered
the boy.</p>
<p>“That is a long journey,” declared the Nome.</p>
<p>“I shall transform myself into a bird,” said Kiki,
“and so fly to the Rose Kingdom in an hour.”</p>
<p>“Then transform me, also, into a bird, and I will
go with you,” suggested Ruggedo. “But, in that
case, let us fly together to the Land of Oz, and see
what it looks like.”</p>
<p>Kiki thought this over. Pleasant as were the countries
he had visited, he heard everywhere that the
Land of Oz was more beautiful and delightful. The
Land of Oz was his own country, too, and if there
was any possibility of his becoming its King, he must
know something about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>While Kiki the Hyup thought, Ruggedo the Nome
was also thinking. This boy possessed a marvelous
power, and although very simple in some ways, he
was determined not to part with his secret. However,
if Ruggedo could get him to transport the wily
old Nome to Oz, which he could reach in no other
way, he might then induce the boy to follow his advice
and enter into the plot for revenge, which he had
already planned in his wicked heart.</p>
<p>“There are wizards and magicians in Oz,” remarked
Kiki, after a time. “They might discover us, in spite
of our transformations.”</p>
<p>“Not if we are careful,” Ruggedo assured him.
“Ozma has a Magic Picture, in which she can see
whatever she wishes to see; but Ozma will know
nothing of our going to Oz, and so she will not command
her Magic Picture to show where we are or
what we are doing. Glinda the Good has a Great
Book called the Book of Records, in which is magically
written everything that people do in the Land of Oz,
just the instant they do it.”</p>
<p>“Then,” said Kiki, “there is no use our attempting
to conquer the country, for Glinda would read in her
book all that we do, and as her magic is greater than
mine, she would soon put a stop to our plans.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>“I said ‘people,’ didn’t I?” retorted the Nome.
“The book doesn’t make a record of what birds do,
or beasts. It only tells the doings of people. So, if
we fly into the country as birds, Glinda won’t know
anything about it.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="323" src="images/i044.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i044.jpg">
</div>
<p>“Two birds couldn’t conquer the Land of Oz,”
asserted the boy, scornfully.</p>
<p>“No; that’s true,” admitted Ruggedo, and then he
rubbed his forehead and stroked his long pointed
beard and thought some more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>“Ah, now I have the idea!” he declared. “I suppose
you can transform us into beasts as well as
birds?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“And can you make a bird a beast, and a beast a
bird again, without taking a human form in between?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” said Kiki. “I can transform myself
or others into anything that can talk. There’s a magic
word that must be spoken in connection with the
transformations, and as beasts and birds and dragons
and fishes can talk in Oz, we may become any of these
we desire to. However, if I transformed myself into
a tree, I would always remain a tree, because then
I could not utter the magic word to change the
transformation.”</p>
<p>“I see; I see,” said Ruggedo, nodding his bushy,
white head until the point of his hair waved back
and forth like a pendulum. “That fits in with my
idea, exactly. Now, listen, and I’ll explain to you
my plan. We’ll fly to Oz as birds and settle in one
of the thick forests in the Gillikin Country. There
you will transform us into powerful beasts, and as
Glinda doesn’t keep any track of the doings of beasts
we can act without being discovered.”</p>
<p>“But how can two beasts raise an army to conquer
the powerful people of Oz?” inquired Kiki.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>“That’s easy. But not an army of <i>people</i>, mind
you. That would be quickly discovered. And while
we are in Oz you and I will never resume our human
forms until we’ve conquered the country and destroyed
Glinda, and Ozma, and the Wizard, and Dorothy, and
all the rest, and so have nothing more to fear from
them.”</p>
<p>“It is impossible to kill anyone in the Land of Oz,”
declared Kiki.</p>
<p>“It isn’t necessary to kill the Oz people,” rejoined
Ruggedo.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I don’t understand you,” objected the
boy. “What will happen to the Oz people, and what
sort of an army could we get together, except of
people?”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you. The forests of Oz are full of beasts.
Some of them, in the far-away places, are savage and
cruel, and would gladly follow a leader as savage as
themselves. They have never troubled the Oz people
much, because they had no leader to urge them on,
but we will tell them to help us conquer Oz and as
a reward we will transform all the beasts into men
and women, and let them live in the houses and enjoy
all the good things; and we will transform all the
people of Oz into beasts of various sorts, and send
them to live in the forests and the jungles. That is
a splendid idea, you must admit, and it’s so easy that
we won’t have any trouble at all to carry it through
to success.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>“Will the beasts consent, do you think?” asked
the boy.</p>
<p>“To be sure they will. We can get every beast in
Oz on our side—except a few who live in Ozma’s
palace, and they won’t count.”</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER 4</p>
<p>Kiki Aru didn’t know much
about Oz and didn’t know
much about the beasts who
lived there, but the old Nome’s
plan seemed to him to be
quite reasonable. He had a
faint suspicion that Ruggedo
meant to get the best of him
in some way, and he resolved
to keep a close watch on his
fellow-conspirator. As long
as he kept to himself the
secret word of the transformations,
Ruggedo would not dare to harm him, and
he promised himself that as soon as they had conquered
Oz, he would transform the old Nome into a
marble statue and keep him in that form forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Ruggedo, on his part, decided that he could, by
careful watching and listening, surprise the boy’s
secret, and when he had learned the magic word he
would transform Kiki Aru into a bundle of faggots
and burn him up and so be rid of him.</p>
<p>This is always the way with wicked people. They
cannot be trusted even by one another. Ruggedo
thought he was fooling Kiki, and Kiki thought he was
fooling Ruggedo; so both were pleased.</p>
<p>“It’s a long way across the Desert,” remarked the
boy, “and the sands are hot and send up poisonous
vapors. Let us wait until evening and then fly across
in the night when it will be cooler.”</p>
<p>The former Nome King agreed to this, and the two
spent the rest of that day in talking over their plans.
When evening came they paid the inn-keeper and
walked out to a little grove of trees that stood near by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>“Remain here for a few minutes and I’ll soon be
back,” said Kiki, and walking swiftly away, he left
the Nome standing in the grove. Ruggedo wondered
where he had gone, but stood quietly in his place until,
all of a sudden, his form changed to that of a great
eagle, and he uttered a piercing cry of astonishment
and flapped his wings in a sort of panic. At once his
eagle cry was answered from beyond the grove, and
another eagle, even larger and more powerful than
the transformed Ruggedo, came sailing through the
trees and alighted beside him.</p>
<p>“Now we are ready for the start,” said the voice
of Kiki, coming from the eagle.</p>
<p>Ruggedo realized that this time he had been outwitted.
He had thought Kiki would utter the magic
word in his presence, and so he would learn what it
was, but the boy had been too shrewd for that.</p>
<p>As the two eagles mounted high into the air and
began their flight across the great Desert that separates
the Land of Oz from all the rest of the world,
the Nome said:</p>
<p>“When I was king of the Nomes I had a magic way
of working transformations that I thought was good,
but it could not compare with your secret word. I
had to have certain tools and make passes and say a
lot of mystic words before I could transform anybody.”</p>
<p>“What became of your magic tools?” inquired Kiki.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>

<p>“The Oz people took them all away from me—that
horrid girl, Dorothy, and that terrible fairy, Ozma,
the Ruler of Oz—at the time they took away my
underground kingdom and kicked me upstairs into
the cold, heartless world.”</p>
<p>“Why did you let them do that?” asked the boy.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="358" src="images/i052.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i052.jpg">
</div>
<p>“Well,” said Ruggedo, “I couldn’t help it. They
rolled eggs at me—<i>eggs</i>—dreadful eggs!—and if
an egg even touches a Nome, he is ruined for life.”</p>
<p>“Is any kind of an egg dangerous to a Nome?”</p>
<p>“Any kind and every kind. An egg is the only
thing I’m afraid of.”</p>

<p>There is no other country so
beautiful as the Land of Oz.
There are no other people so
happy and contented and
prosperous as the Oz people.
They have all they desire;
they love and admire their
beautiful girl Ruler, Ozma
of Oz, and they mix work
and play so justly that both
are delightful and satisfying
and no one has any reason to
complain. Once in a while
something happens in Oz to disturb the people’s happiness
for a brief time, for so rich and attractive a
fairyland is sure to make a few selfish and greedy
outsiders envious, and therefore certain evil-doers
have treacherously plotted to conquer Oz and enslave
its people and destroy its girl Ruler, and so gain the
wealth of Oz for themselves. But up to the time when
the cruel and crafty Nome, Ruggedo, conspired with
Kiki Aru, the Hyup, all such attempts had failed.
The Oz people suspected no danger. Life in the
world’s nicest fairyland was one round of joyous,
happy days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>In the center of the Emerald City of Oz, the capital
city of Ozma’s dominions, is a vast and beautiful garden,
surrounded by a wall inlaid with shining emeralds,
and in the center of this garden stands Ozma’s
Royal Palace, the most splendid building ever constructed.
From a hundred towers and domes floated
the banners of Oz, which included the Ozmies, the
Munchkins, the Gillikins, the Winkies and the Quadlings.
The banner of the Munchkins is blue, that of
the Winkies yellow; the Gillikin banner is purple,
and the Quadling’s banner is red. The colors of the
Emerald City are of course green. Ozma’s own banner
has a green center, and is divided into four quarters.
These quarters are colored blue, purple, yellow
and red, indicating that she rules over all the countries
of the Land of Oz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>This fairyland is so big, however, that all of it is
not yet known to its girl Ruler, and it is said that in
some far parts of the country, in forests and mountain
fastnesses, in hidden valleys and thick jungles,
are people and beasts that know as little about Ozma
as she knows of them. Still, these unknown subjects
are not nearly so numerous as the known inhabitants
of Oz, who occupy all the countries near to the Emerald
City. Indeed, I’m sure it will not be long until
all parts of the fairyland of Oz are explored and their
peoples made acquainted with their Ruler, for in
Ozma’s palace are several of her friends who are so
curious that they are constantly discovering new and
extraordinary places and inhabitants.</p>
<p>One of the most frequent discoverers of these hidden
places in Oz is a little Kansas girl named Dorothy,
who is Ozma’s dearest friend and lives in luxurious
rooms in the Royal Palace. Dorothy is, indeed, a
Princess of Oz, but she does not like to be called a
princess, and because she is simple and sweet and does
not pretend to be anything but an ordinary little girl,
she is called just “Dorothy” by everybody and is the
most popular person, next to Ozma, in all the Land
of Oz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="405" src="images/i056.jpg" width="600" id="img_images_i056.jpg">
</div>
<p>One morning Dorothy crossed the hall of the palace
and knocked on the door of another girl named Trot,
also a guest and friend of Ozma. When told to enter,
Dorothy found that Trot had company, an old sailor-man
with one wooden leg and one meat leg, who was
sitting by the open window puffing smoke from a
corn-cob pipe. This sailor-man was named Cap’n Bill,
and he had accompanied Trot to the Land of Oz and
was her oldest and most faithful comrade and friend.
Dorothy liked Cap’n Bill, too, and after she had greeted
him, she said to Trot:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>“You know, Ozma’s birthday is next month, and
I’ve been wondering what I can give her as a birthday
present. She’s so good to us all that we certainly
ought to remember her birthday.”</p>
<p>“That’s true,” agreed Trot. “I’ve been wondering,
too, what I could give Ozma. It’s pretty hard to
decide, ’cause she’s got already all she wants, and as
she’s a fairy and knows a lot about magic, she could
satisfy any wish.”</p>
<p>“I know,” returned Dorothy, “but that isn’t the
point. It isn’t that Ozma <i>needs</i> anything, but that
it will please her to know we’ve remembered her birthday.
But what shall we give her?”</p>
<p>Trot shook her head in despair.</p>
<p>“I’ve tried to think and I can’t,” she declared.</p>
<p>“It’s the same way with me,” said Dorothy.</p>
<p>“I know one thing that ’ud please her,” remarked
Cap’n Bill, turning his round face with its fringe of
whiskers toward the two girls and staring at them
with his big, light-blue eyes wide open.</p>
<p>“What is it, Cap’n Bill?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>“It’s an Enchanted Flower,” said he. “It’s a pretty
plant that stands in a golden flower-pot an’ grows all
sorts o’ flowers, one after another. One minute a fine
rose buds an’ blooms, an’ then a tulip, an’ next a
chrys—chrys—”</p>
<p>“—anthemum,” said Dorothy, helping him.</p>
<p>“That’s it; and next a dahlia, an’ then a daffydil,
an’ on all through the range o’ posies. Jus’ as soon
as one fades away, another comes, of a different sort,
an’ the perfume from ’em is mighty snifty, an’ they
keeps bloomin’ night and day, year in an’ year out.”</p>
<p>“That’s wonderful!” exclaimed Dorothy. “I think
Ozma would like it.”</p>
<p>“But where is the Magic Flower, and how can we
get it?” asked Trot.</p>
<p>“Dun’no, zac’ly,” slowly replied Cap’n Bill. “The
Glass Cat tol’ me about it only yesterday, an’ said it
was in some lonely place up at the nor’east o’ here.
The Glass Cat goes travelin’ all around Oz, you know,
an’ the little critter sees a lot o’ things no one else
does.”</p>
<p>“That’s true,” said Dorothy, thoughtfully. “Northeast
of here must be in the Munchkin Country, and
perhaps a good way off, so let’s ask the Glass Cat to
tell us how to get to the Magic Flower.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>So the two girls, with Cap’n Bill stumping along on
his wooden leg after them, went out into the garden,
and after some time spent in searching, they found
the Glass Cat curled up in the sunshine beside a bush,
fast asleep.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="333" src="images/i059.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i059.jpg">
</div>
<p>The Glass Cat is one of the most curious creatures
in all Oz. It was made by a famous magician named
Dr. Pipt before Ozma had forbidden her subjects to
work magic. Dr. Pipt had made the Glass Cat to
catch mice, but the Cat refused to catch mice and was
considered more curious than useful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>This astonishing cat was made all of glass and was
so clear and transparent that you could see through
it as easily as through a window. In the top of its
head, however, was a mass of delicate pink balls which
looked like jewels but were intended for brains. It
had a heart made of a blood-red ruby. The eyes were
two large emeralds. But, aside from these colors, all
the rest of the animal was of clear glass, and it had
a spun-glass tail that was really beautiful.</p>
<p>“Here, wake up,” said Cap’n Bill. “We want to
talk to you.”</p>
<p>Slowly the Glass Cat got upon its feet, yawned and
then looked at the three who stood before it.</p>
<p>“How dare you disturb me?” it asked in a peevish
voice. “You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.”</p>
<p>“Never mind that,” returned the Sailor. “Do you
remember tellin’ me yesterday ’bout a Magic Flower
in a Gold Pot?”</p>
<p>“Do you think I’m a fool? Look at my brains—you
can see ’em work. Of course I remember!” said
the cat.</p>
<p>“Well, where can we find it?”</p>
<p>“You can’t. It’s none of your business, anyhow.
Go away and let me sleep,” advised the Glass Cat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>“Now, see here,” said Dorothy; “we want the Magic
Flower to give to Ozma on her birthday. You’d be
glad to please Ozma, wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” replied the creature. “Why should
I want to please anybody?”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="345" src="images/i061.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i061.jpg">
</div>
<p>“You’ve got a heart, ’cause I can see it inside of
you,” said Trot.</p>
<p>“Yes; it’s a pretty heart, and I’m fond of it,” said
the cat, twisting around to view its own body. “But
it’s made from a ruby, and it’s hard as nails.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you good for <i>any</i>thing?” asked Trot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>“Yes, I’m pretty to look at, and that’s more than
can be said of you,” retorted the creature.</p>
<p>Trot laughed at this, and Dorothy, who understood
the Glass Cat pretty well, said soothingly:</p>
<p>“You are indeed beautiful, and if you can tell Cap’n
Bill where to find the Magic Flower, all the people in
Oz will praise your cleverness. The Flower will belong
to Ozma, but everyone will know the Glass Cat discovered
it.”</p>
<p>This was the kind of praise the crystal creature
liked.</p>
<p>“Well,” it said, while the pink brains rolled around,
“I found the Magic Flower way up in the north of
the Munchkin Country where few people live or ever
go. There’s a river there that flows through a forest,
and in the middle of the river in the middle of the
forest there is a small island on which stands the gold
pot in which grows the Magic Flower.”</p>
<p>“How did you get to the island?” asked Dorothy.
“Glass cats can’t swim.”</p>
<p>“No, but I’m not afraid of water,” was the reply.
“I just walked across the river on the bottom.”</p>
<p>“Under the water?” exclaimed Trot.</p>
<p>The cat gave her a scornful look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>“How could I walk <i>over</i> the water on the <i>bottom</i>
of the river? If you were transparent, anyone could
see <i>your</i> brains were not working. But I’m sure you
could never find the place alone. It has always been
hidden from the Oz people.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="337" src="images/i063.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i063.jpg">
</div>
<p>“But you, with your fine pink brains, could find it
again, I s’pose,” remarked Dorothy.</p>
<p>“Yes; and if you want that Magic Flower for Ozma,
I’ll go with you and show you the way.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>“That’s lovely of you!” declared Dorothy. “Trot
and Cap’n Bill will go with you, for this is to be their
birthday present to Ozma. While you’re gone I’ll have
to find something else to give her.”</p>
<p>“All right. Come on, then, Cap’n,” said the Glass
Cat, starting to move away.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” begged Trot. “How long will
we be gone?”</p>
<p>“Oh, about a week.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll put some things in a basket to take with
us,” said the girl, and ran into the palace to make her
preparations for the journey.</p>

<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="679" src="images/i065.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i065.jpg">
</div>
<p class="center">CHAPTER 6</p>
<p>When Cap’n Bill and Trot
and the Glass Cat had started
for the hidden island in the
far-off river to get the Magic
Flower, Dorothy wondered
again what she could give
Ozma on her birthday. She
met the Patchwork Girl and
said:</p>
<p>“What are you going to
give Ozma for a birthday
present?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>“I’ve written a song for
her,” answered the strange Patchwork Girl, who went
by the name of “Scraps,” and who, though stuffed
with cotton, had a fair assortment of mixed brains.
“It’s a splendid song and the chorus runs this way:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">“I am crazy;</p>
<p class="t3">You’re a daisy,</p>
<p class="t4">Ozma dear;</p>
<p class="t3">I’m demented;</p>
<p class="t3">You’re contented,</p>
<p class="t4">Ozma dear;</p>
<p class="t0">I am patched and gay and glary;</p>
<p class="t0">You’re a sweet and lovely fairy;</p>
<p class="t0">May your birthdays all be happy,</p>
<p class="t4">Ozma dear!”</p>
</div>
<p>“How do you like it, Dorothy?” inquired the Patchwork
Girl.</p>
<p>“Is it good poetry, Scraps?” asked Dorothy, doubtfully.</p>
<p>“It’s as good as any ordinary song,” was the reply.
“I have given it a dandy title, too. I shall call the
song: ‘When Ozma Has a Birthday, Everybody’s Sure
to Be Gay, for She Cannot Help the Fact That She
Was Born.’”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>“That’s a pretty long title, Scraps,” said Dorothy.</p>
<p>“That makes it stylish,” replied the Patchwork
Girl, turning a somersault and alighting on one stuffed
foot. “Now-a-days the titles are sometimes longer
than the songs.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="336" src="images/i067.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i067.jpg">
</div>
<p>Dorothy left her and walked slowly toward the palace,
where she met the Tin Woodman just going up
the front steps.</p>
<p>“What are you going to give Ozma on her birthday?”
she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>“It’s a secret, but I’ll tell you,” replied the Tin
Woodman, who was Emperor of the Winkies. “I am
having my people make Ozma a lovely girdle set with
beautiful tin nuggets. Each tin nugget will be surrounded
by a circle of emeralds, just to set it off to
good advantage. The clasp of the girdle will be pure
tin! Won’t that be fine?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure she’ll like it,” said Dorothy. “Do you
know what <i>I</i> can give her?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea, Dorothy. It took me
three months to think of my own present for Ozma.”</p>
<p>The girl walked thoughtfully around to the back
of the palace, and presently came upon the famous
Scarecrow of Oz, who was having two of the palace
servants stuff his legs with fresh straw.</p>
<p>“What are you going to give Ozma on her birthday?”
asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>“I want to surprise her,” answered the Scarecrow.</p>
<p>“I won’t tell,” promised Dorothy.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m having some straw slippers made for
her—all straw, mind you, and braided very artistically.
Ozma has always admired my straw filling,
so I’m sure she’ll be pleased with these lovely straw
slippers.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>“Ozma will be pleased with anything her loving
friends give her,” said the girl. “What <i>I’m</i> worried
about, Scarecrow, is what to give Ozma that she hasn’t
got already.”</p>
<p>“That’s what worried me, until I thought of the
slippers,” said the Scarecrow. “You’ll have to <i>think</i>,
Dorothy; that’s the only way to get a good idea. If
I hadn’t such wonderful brains, I’d never have thought
of those straw foot-decorations.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="335" src="images/i069.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i069.jpg">
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Dorothy left him and went to her room, where she
sat down and tried to think hard. A Pink Kitten was
curled up on the window-sill and Dorothy asked her:</p>
<p>“What can I give Ozma for her birthday present?”</p>
<p>“Oh, give her some milk,” replied the Pink Kitten;
“that’s the nicest thing I know of.”</p>
<p>A fuzzy little black dog had squatted down at Dorothy’s
feet and now looked up at her with intelligent
eyes.</p>
<p>“Tell me, Toto,” said the girl; “what would Ozma
like best for a birthday present?”</p>
<p>The little black dog wagged his tail.</p>
<p>“Your love,” said he. “Ozma wants to be loved
more than anything else.”</p>
<p>“But I already love her, Toto!”</p>
<p>“Then tell her you love her twice as much as you
ever did before.”</p>
<p>“That wouldn’t be true,” objected Dorothy, “for
I’ve always loved her as much as I could, and, really,
Toto, I want to give Ozma some <i>present</i>, ’cause everyone
else will give her a present.”</p>
<p>“Let me see,” said Toto. “How would it be to give
her that useless Pink Kitten?”</p>
<p>“No, Toto; that wouldn’t do.”</p>
<p>“Then six kisses.”</p>
<p>“No; that’s no present.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>“Well, I guess you’ll have to figure it out for yourself,
Dorothy,” said the little dog. “To <i>my</i> notion
you’re more particular than Ozma will be.”</p>
<p>Dorothy decided that if anyone could help her it
would be Glinda the Good, the wonderful Sorceress
of Oz who was Ozma’s faithful subject and friend. But
Glinda’s castle was in the Quadling Country and quite
a journey from the Emerald City.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="337" src="images/i071.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i071.jpg">
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>So the little girl went to Ozma and asked permission
to use the Wooden Sawhorse and the royal Red Wagon
to pay a visit to Glinda, and the girl Ruler kissed Princess
Dorothy and graciously granted permission.</p>
<p>The Wooden Sawhorse was one of the most remarkable
creatures in Oz. Its body was a small log and its
legs were limbs of trees stuck in the body. Its eyes
were knots, its mouth was sawed in the end of the log
and its ears were two chips. A small branch had been
left at the rear end of the log to serve as a tail.</p>
<p>Ozma herself, during one of her early adventures,
had brought this wooden horse to life, and so she was
much attached to the queer animal and had shod the
bottoms of its wooden legs with plates of gold so they
would not wear out. The sawhorse was a swift and
willing traveler, and though it could talk if need arose,
it seldom said anything unless spoken to. When the
Sawhorse was harnessed to the Red Wagon there were
no reins to guide him because all that was needed was
to tell him where to go.</p>
<p>Dorothy now told him to go to Glinda’s Castle and
the Sawhorse carried her there with marvelous speed.</p>
<p>“Glinda,” said Dorothy, when she had been greeted
by the Sorceress, who was tall and stately, with handsome
and dignified features and dressed in a splendid
and becoming gown, “what are you going to give
Ozma for a birthday present?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The Sorceress smiled and answered:</p>
<p>“Come into my patio and I will show you.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="341" src="images/i073.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i073.jpg">
</div>
<p>So they entered a place that was surrounded by the
wings of the great castle but had no roof, and was
filled with flowers and fountains and exquisite statuary
and many settees and chairs of polished marble
or filigree gold. Here there were gathered fifty beautiful
young girls, Glinda’s handmaids, who had been
selected from all parts of the Land of Oz on account
of their wit and beauty and sweet dispositions. It
was a great honor to be made one of Glinda’s handmaidens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>When Dorothy followed the Sorceress into this
delightful patio all the fifty girls were busily weaving,
and their shuttles were filled with a sparkling green
spun glass such as the little girl had never seen before.</p>
<p>“What is it, Glinda?” she asked.</p>
<p>“One of my recent discoveries,” explained the Sorceress.
“I have found a way to make threads from
emeralds, by softening the stones and then spinning
them into long, silken strands. With these emerald
threads we are weaving cloth to make Ozma a splendid
court gown for her birthday. You will notice that
the threads have all the beautiful glitter and luster of
the emeralds from which they are made, and so Ozma’s
new dress will be the most magnificent the world has
ever seen, and quite fitting for our lovely Ruler of the
Fairyland of Oz.”</p>
<p>Dorothy’s eyes were fairly dazed by the brilliance
of the emerald cloth, some of which the girls had
already woven.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen <i>any</i>thing so beautiful!” she said,
with a sigh. “But tell me, Glinda, what can <i>I</i> give
our lovely Ozma on her birthday?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The good Sorceress considered this question for a
long time before she replied. Finally she said:</p>
<p>“Of course there will be a grand feast at the Royal
Palace on Ozma’s birthday, and all our friends will
be present. So I suggest that you make a fine
big birthday cake for Ozma, and surround it with
candles.”</p>
<p>“Oh, just a <i>cake</i>!” exclaimed Dorothy, in disappointment.</p>
<p>“Nothing is nicer for a birthday,” said the Sorceress.</p>
<p>“How many candles should there be on the cake?”
asked the girl.</p>
<p>“Just a row of them,” replied Glinda, “for no one
knows how old Ozma is, although she appears to us
to be just a young girl—as fresh and fair as if she
had lived but a few years.”</p>
<p>“A cake doesn’t seem like much of a present,” Dorothy
asserted.</p>
<p>“Make it a surprise cake,” suggested the Sorceress.
“Don’t you remember the four and twenty blackbirds
that were baked in a pie? Well, you need not use live
blackbirds in your cake, but you could have some surprise
of a different sort.”</p>
<p>“Like what?” questioned Dorothy, eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>“If I told you, it wouldn’t be <i>your</i> present to Ozma,
but <i>mine</i>,” answered the Sorceress, with a smile.
“Think it over, my dear, and I am sure you can originate
a surprise that will add greatly to the joy and
merriment of Ozma’s birthday banquet.”</p>
<p>Dorothy thanked her friend and entered the Red
Wagon and told the Sawhorse to take her back home
to the palace in the Emerald City.</p>
<p>On the way she thought the matter over seriously
of making a surprise birthday cake and finally decided
what to do.</p>
<p>As soon as she reached home, she went to the Wizard
of Oz, who had a room fitted up in one of the high
towers of the palace, where he studied magic so as to
be able to perform such wizardry as Ozma commanded
him to do for the welfare of her subjects.</p>
<p>The Wizard and Dorothy were firm friends and had
enjoyed many strange adventures together. He was
a little man with a bald head and sharp eyes and a
round, jolly face, and because he was neither haughty
nor proud he had become a great favorite with the Oz
people.</p>
<p>“Wizard,” said Dorothy, “I want you to help me
fix up a present for Ozma’s birthday.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be glad to do anything for you and for Ozma,”
he answered. “What’s on your mind, Dorothy?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>“I’m going to make a great cake, with frosting and
candles, and all that, you know.”</p>
<p>“Very good,” said the Wizard.</p>
<p>“In the center of this cake I’m going to leave a
hollow place, with just a roof of the frosting over it,”
continued the girl.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="338" src="images/i077.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i077.jpg">
</div>
<p>“Very good,” repeated the Wizard, nodding his
bald head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>“In that hollow place,” said Dorothy, “I want to
hide a lot of monkeys about three inches high, and
after the cake is placed on the banquet table, I want
the monkeys to break through the frosting and dance
around on the table-cloth. Then, I want each monkey
to cut out a piece of cake and hand it to a guest.”</p>
<p>“Mercy me!” cried the little Wizard, as he chuckled
with laughter. “Is that <i>all</i> you want, Dorothy?”</p>
<p>“Almost,” said she. “Can you think of anything
more the little monkeys can do, Wizard?”</p>
<p>“Not just now,” he replied. “But where will you
get such tiny monkeys?”</p>
<p>“That’s where you’re to help me,” said Dorothy.
“In some of those wild forests in the Gillikin Country
are lots of monkeys.”</p>
<p>“Big ones,” said the Wizard.</p>
<p>“Well, you and I will go there, and we’ll get some
of the big monkeys, and you will make them small—just
three inches high—by means of your magic, and
we’ll put the little monkeys all in a basket and bring
them home with us. Then you’ll train them to dance—up
here in your room, where no one can see them—and
on Ozma’s birthday we’ll put ’em into the cake
and they’ll know by that time just what to do.”</p>
<p>The Wizard looked at Dorothy with admiring
approval, and chuckled again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>“That’s really clever, my dear,” he said, “and I see
no reason why we can’t do it, just the way you say, if
only we can get the wild monkeys to agree to it.”</p>
<p>“Do you think they’ll object?” asked the girl.</p>
<p>“Yes; but perhaps we can argue them into it. Anyhow,
it’s worth trying, and I’ll help you if you’ll agree
to let this Surprise Cake be a present to Ozma from
you and me together. I’ve been wondering what <i>I</i>
could give Ozma, and as I’ve got to train the monkeys
as well as make them small, I think you ought to make
me your partner.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Dorothy; “I’ll be glad to do so.”</p>
<p>“Then, it’s a bargain,” declared the Wizard. “We
must go to seek those monkeys at once, however, for
it will take time to train them and we’ll have to travel
a good way to the Gillikin forests where they live.”</p>
<p>“I’m ready to go any time,” agreed Dorothy. “Shall
we ask Ozma to let us take the Sawhorse?”</p>
<p>The Wizard did not answer that at once. He took
time to think of the suggestion.</p>
<p>“No,” he answered at length, “the Red Wagon
couldn’t get through the thick forests and there’s some
danger to us in going into the wild places to search
for monkeys. So I propose we take the Cowardly Lion
and the Hungry Tiger. We can ride on their backs
as well as in the Red Wagon, and if there is danger
to us from other beasts, these two friendly champions
will protect us from all harm.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>“That’s a splendid idea!” exclaimed Dorothy.
“Let’s go now and ask the Hungry Tiger and the
Cowardly Lion if they will help us. Shall we ask
Ozma if we can go?”</p>
<p>“I think not,” said the Wizard, getting his hat and
his black bag of magic tools. “This is to be a surprise
for her birthday, and so she mustn’t know where
we’re going. We’ll just leave word, in case Ozma
inquires for us, that we’ll be back in a few days.”</p>

</div>
<p class="center">CHAPTER 7</p>
<p>In the central western part
of the Gillikin Country is a
great tangle of trees called
Gugu Forest. It is the biggest
forest in all Oz and
stretches miles and miles in
every direction—north,
south, east and west. Adjoining
it on the east side is a
range of rugged mountains
covered with underbrush and
small twisted trees. You can
find this place by looking at the Map of the Land of Oz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Gugu Forest is the home of most of the wild beasts
that inhabit Oz. These are seldom disturbed in their
leafy haunts because there is no reason why Oz people
should go there, except on rare occasions, and most
parts of the forest have never been seen by any eyes
but the eyes of the beasts who make their home there.
The biggest beasts inhabit the great forest, while the
smaller ones live mostly in the mountain underbrush
at the east.</p>
<p>Now, you must know that there are laws in the
forests, as well as in every other place, and these laws
are made by the beasts themselves, and are necessary
to keep them from fighting and tearing one another
to pieces. In Gugu Forest there is a King—an enormous
yellow leopard called “Gugu”—after whom
the forest is named. And this King has three other
beasts to advise him in keeping the laws and maintaining
order—Bru the Bear, Loo the Unicorn and
Rango the Gray Ape—who are known as the King’s
Counselors. All these are fierce and ferocious beasts,
and hold their high offices because they are more intelligent
and more feared than their fellows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Since Oz became a fairyland, no man, woman or
child ever dies in that land nor is anyone ever sick.
Likewise the beasts of the forests never die, so that
long years add to their cunning and wisdom, as well
as to their size and strength. It is possible for beasts—or
even people—to be destroyed, but the task is
so difficult that it is seldom attempted. Because it is
free from sickness and death is one reason why Oz
is a fairyland, but it is doubtful whether those who
come to Oz from the outside world, as Dorothy and
Button-Bright and Trot and Cap’n Bill and the Wizard
did, will live forever or cannot be injured. Even
Ozma is not sure about this, and so the guests of
Ozma from other lands are always carefully protected
from any danger, so as to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>In spite of the laws of the forests there are often
fights among the beasts; some of them have lost an
eye or an ear or even had a leg torn off. The King
and the King’s Counselors always punish those who
start a fight, but so fierce is the nature of some beasts
that they will at times fight in spite of laws and
punishment.</p>
<p>Over this vast, wild Forest of Gugu flew two eagles,
one morning, and near the center of the jungle the
eagles alighted on a branch of a tall tree.</p>
<p>“Here is the place for us to begin our work,” said
one, who was Ruggedo, the Nome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>“Do many beasts live here?” asked Kiki Aru,
the other eagle.</p>
<p>“The forest is full of them,” said the Nome. “There
are enough beasts right here to enable us to conquer
the people of Oz, if we can get them to consent
to join us. To do that, we must go among them and
tell them our plans, so we must now decide on what
shapes we had better assume while in the forest.”</p>
<p>“I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?”
said Kiki.</p>
<p>“Of course. But that requires some thought. All
kinds of beasts live here, and a yellow leopard is
King. If we become leopards, the King will be
jealous of us. If we take the forms of some of the
other beasts, we shall not command proper respect.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if the beasts will attack us?” asked
Kiki.</p>
<p>“I’m a Nome, and immortal, so nothing can hurt
me,” replied Ruggedo.</p>
<p>“I was born in the Land of Oz, so nothing can
hurt me,” said Kiki.</p>
<p>“But, in order to carry out our plans, we must
win the favor of all the animals of the forest.”</p>
<p>“Then what shall we do?” asked Kiki.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>“Let us mix the shapes of several beasts, so we
will not look like any one of them,” proposed the
wily old Nome. “Let us have the heads of lions,
the bodies of monkeys, the wings of eagles and the
tails of wild asses, with knobs of gold on the end
of them instead of bunches of hair.”</p>
<p>“Won’t that make a queer combination?” inquired
Kiki.</p>
<p>“The queerer the better,” declared Ruggedo.</p>
<p>“All right,” said Kiki. “You stay here, and I’ll
fly away to another tree and transform us both, and
then we’ll climb down our trees and meet in the
forest.”</p>
<p>“No,” said the Nome, “we mustn’t separate. You
must transform us while we are together.”</p>
<p>“I won’t do that,” asserted Kiki, firmly. “You’re
trying to get my secret, and I won’t let you.”</p>
<p>The eyes of the other eagle flashed angrily, but
Ruggedo did not dare insist. If he offended this
boy, he might have to remain an eagle always and
he wouldn’t like that. Some day he hoped to be
able to learn the secret word of the magical transformations,
but just now he must let Kiki have his
own way.</p>
<p>“All right,” he said gruffly; “do as you please.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>So Kiki flew to a tree that was far enough distant
so that Ruggedo could not overhear him and said:
“I want Ruggedo, the Nome, and myself to have
the heads of lions, the bodies of monkeys, the wings
of eagles and the tails of wild asses, with knobs of
gold on the ends of them instead of bunches of hair—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl!</span>”</p>
<p>He pronounced the magic word in the proper manner
and at once his form changed to the one he had
described. He spread his eagle’s wings and finding
they were strong enough to support his monkey body
and lion head he flew swiftly to the tree where he
had left Ruggedo. The Nome was also transformed
and was climbing down the tree because the branches
all around him were so thickly entwined that there
was no room between them to fly.</p>
<p>Kiki quickly joined his comrade and it did not take
them long to reach the ground.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER 8</p>
<p>There had been trouble in the
Forest of Gugu that morning.
Chipo the Wild Boar had bitten
the tail off Arx the Giraffe
while the latter had his head
among the leaves of a tree,
eating his breakfast. Arx
kicked with his heels and
struck Tirrip, the great Kangaroo,
who had a new baby
in her pouch. Tirrip knew
it was the Wild Boar’s fault,
so she knocked him over with one powerful blow and
then ran away to escape Chipo’s sharp tusks. In
the chase that followed a giant porcupine stuck fifty
sharp quills into the Boar and a chimpanzee in a tree
threw a cocoanut at the porcupine that jammed its
head into its body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>All this was against the Laws of the Forest, and
when the excitement was over, Gugu the Leopard
King called his royal Counselors together to decide
how best to punish the offenders.</p>
<p>The four lords of the forest were holding solemn
council in a small clearing when they saw two strange
beasts approaching them—beasts the like of which
they had never seen before.</p>
<p>Not one of the four, however, relaxed his dignity
or showed by a movement that he was startled. The
great Leopard crouched at full length upon a fallen
tree-trunk. Bru the Bear sat on his haunches before
the King; Rango the Gray Ape stood with his muscular
arms folded, and Loo the Unicorn reclined,
much as a horse does, between his fellow-councillors.
With one consent they remained silent, eyeing with
steadfast looks the intruders, who were making their
way into their forest domain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>“Well met, Brothers!” said one of the strange
beasts, coming to a halt beside the group, while his
comrade with hesitation lagged behind.</p>
<p>“We are not brothers,” returned the Gray Ape,
sternly. “Who are you, and how came you in the
forest of Gugu?”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="331" src="images/i089.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i089.jpg">
</div>
<p>“We are two Li-Mon-Eags,” said Ruggedo, inventing
the name. “Our home is in Sky Island, and we
have come to earth to warn the forest beasts that the
people of Oz are about to make war upon them and
enslave them, so that they will become beasts of burden
forever after and obey only the will of their two-legged
masters.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>A low roar of anger arose from the Council of
Beasts.</p>
<p>“<i>Who’s</i> going to do that?” asked Loo the Unicorn,
in a high, squeaky voice, at the same time rising to
his feet.</p>
<p>“The people of Oz,” said Ruggedo.</p>
<p>“But what will <i>we</i> be doing?” inquired the Unicorn.</p>
<p>“That’s what I’ve come to talk to you about.”</p>
<p>“You needn’t talk! We’ll fight the Oz people!”
screamed the Unicorn. “We’ll smash ’em; we’ll trample
’em; we’ll gore ’em; we’ll—”</p>
<p>“Silence!” growled Gugu the King, and Loo
obeyed, although still trembling with wrath. The
cold, steady gaze of the Leopard wandered over the
two strange beasts. “The people of Oz,” said he,
“have not been our friends; they have not been our
enemies. They have let us alone, and we have let
them alone. There is no reason for war between us.
They have no slaves. They could not use us as slaves
if they should conquer us. I think you are telling us
lies, you strange Li-Mon-Eag—you mixed-up beast
who are neither one thing nor another.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>“Oh, on my word, it’s the truth!” protested the
Nome in the beast’s shape. “I wouldn’t lie for the
world; I—”</p>
<p>“Silence!” again growled Gugu the King; and,
somehow, even Ruggedo was abashed and obeyed the
edict.</p>
<p>“What do you say, Bru?” asked the king, turning
to the great Bear, who had until now said nothing.</p>
<p>“How does the Mixed Beast know that what he
says is true?” asked the Bear.</p>
<p>“Why, I can fly, you know, having the wings of an
Eagle,” explained the Nome. “I and my comrade
yonder,” turning to Kiki, “flew to a grove in Oz, and
there we heard the people telling how they will make
many ropes to snare you beasts, and then they will
surround this forest, and all other forests, and make
you prisoners. So we came here to warn you, for
being beasts ourselves, although we live in the sky,
we are your friends.”</p>
<p>The Leopard’s lip curled and showed his enormous
teeth, sharp as needles. He turned to the Gray Ape.</p>
<p>“What do <i>you</i> think, Rango?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Send these mixed beasts away, your Majesty,”
replied the Gray Ape. “They are mischief-makers.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>“Don’t do that—don’t do that!” cried the Unicorn,
nervously. “The stranger said he would tell us what
to do. Let him tell us, then. Are we fools, not to
heed a warning?”</p>
<p>Gugu the King turned to Ruggedo.</p>
<p>“Speak, Stranger,” he commanded.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the Nome, “it’s this way: The Land
of Oz is a fine country. The people of Oz have many
good things—houses with soft beds, all sorts of nice-tasting
food, pretty clothes, lovely jewels, and many
other things that beasts know nothing of. Here in
the dark forests the poor beasts have hard work to
get enough to eat and to find a bed to rest in. But
the beasts are better than the people, and why should
they not have all the good things the people have?
So I propose that before the Oz people have the time
to make all those ropes to snare you with, that all
we beasts get together and march against the Oz
people and capture them. Then the beasts will
become the masters and the people their slaves.”</p>
<p>“What good would that do us?” asked Bru the Bear.</p>
<p>“It would save you from slavery, for one thing,
and you could enjoy all the fine things the Oz people
have.”</p>
<p>“Beasts wouldn’t know what to do with the things
people use,” said the Gray Ape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>“But this is only part of my plan,” insisted the
Nome. “Listen to the rest of it. We two Li-Mon-Eags
are powerful magicians. When you have conquered
the Oz people we will transform them all into beasts,
and send them to the forests to live, and we will transform
all the beasts into people, so they can enjoy all
the wonderful delights of the Emerald City.”</p>
<p>For a moment no beast spoke. Then the King said:
“Prove it.”</p>
<p>“Prove what?” asked Ruggedo.</p>
<p>“Prove that you can transform us. If you are a
magician transform the Unicorn into a man. Then
we will believe you. If you fail, we will destroy you.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said the Nome. “But I’m tired, so
I’ll let my comrade make the transformation.”</p>
<p>Kiki Aru had stood back from the circle, but he
had heard all that was said. He now realized that he
must make good Ruggedo’s boast, so he retreated to
the edge of the clearing and whispered the magic
word.</p>
<p>Instantly the Unicorn became a fat, chubby little
man, dressed in the purple Gillikin costume, and it
was hard to tell which was the more astonished, the
King, the Bear, the Ape or the former Unicorn.</p>
<p>“It’s true!” shouted the man-beast. “Good gracious,
look what I am! It’s wonderful!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The King of the Beasts now addressed Ruggedo in
a more friendly tone.</p>
<p>“We must believe your story, since you have given
us proof of your power,” said he. “But why, if you
are so great a magician, cannot you conquer the
Oz people without our help, and so save us the
trouble?”</p>
<p>“Alas!” replied the crafty old Nome, “no magician
is able to do everything. The transformations are
easy to us because we are Li-Mon-Eags, but we cannot
fight, or conquer even such weak creatures as the
Oz people. But we will stay with you and advise and
help you, and we will transform all the Oz people into
beasts, when the time comes, and all the beasts into
people.”</p>
<p>Gugu the King turned to his Counselors.</p>
<p>“How shall we answer this friendly stranger?” he
asked.</p>
<p>Loo the former Unicorn was dancing around and
cutting capers like a clown.</p>
<p>“On my word, your Majesty,” he said, “this being
a man is more fun than being a Unicorn.”</p>
<p>“You look like a fool,” said the Gray Ape.</p>
<p>“Well, I <i>feel</i> fine!” declared the man-beast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>“I think I prefer to be a Bear,” said Big Bru. “I
was born a Bear, and I know a Bear’s ways. So I am
satisfied to live as a Bear lives.”</p>
<p>“That,” said the old Nome, “is because you know
nothing better. When we have conquered the Oz
people, and you become a man, you’ll be glad of it.”</p>
<p>The immense Leopard rested his chin on the log
and seemed thoughtful.</p>
<p>“The beasts of the forest must decide this matter
for themselves,” he said. “Go you, Rango the Gray
Ape, and tell your monkey tribe to order all the forest
beasts to assemble in the Great Clearing at sunrise
to-morrow. When all are gathered together, this
mixed-up Beast who is a magician shall talk to them
and tell them what he has told us. Then, if they
decide to fight the Oz people, who have declared war
on us, I will lead the beasts to battle.”</p>
<p>Rango the Gray Ape turned at once and glided
swiftly through the forest on his mission. The Bear
gave a grunt and walked away. Gugu the King rose
and stretched himself. Then he said to Ruggedo:
“Meet us at sunrise to-morrow,” and with stately
stride vanished among the trees.</p>
<p>The man-unicorn, left alone with the strangers,
suddenly stopped his foolish prancing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>“You’d better make me a Unicorn again,” he said.
“I like being a man, but the forest beasts won’t know
I’m their friend, Loo, and they might tear me in
pieces before morning.”</p>
<p>So Kiki changed him back to his former shape, and
the Unicorn departed to join his people.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="347" src="images/i097.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i097.jpg">
</div>
<p>Ruggedo the Nome was much pleased with his
success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>“To-morrow,” he said to Kiki Aru, “we’ll win over
these beasts and set them to fight and conquer the Oz
people. Then I will have my revenge on Ozma and
Dorothy and all the rest of my enemies.”</p>
<p>“But I am doing all the work,” said Kiki.</p>
<p>“Never mind; you’re going to be King of Oz,”
promised Ruggedo.</p>
<p>“Will the big Leopard let me be King?” asked
the boy anxiously.</p>
<p>The Nome came close to him and whispered:</p>
<p>“If Gugu the Leopard opposes us, you will transform
him into a tree, and then he will be helpless.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” agreed Kiki, and he said to himself:
“I shall also transform this deceitful Nome into a
tree, for he lies and I cannot trust him.”</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER 9</p>
<p>The Glass Cat was a good
guide and led Trot and Cap’n
Bill by straight and easy
paths through all the settled
part of the Munchkin Country,
and then into the north
section where there were few
houses, and finally through a
wild country where there
were no houses or paths at
all. But the walking was
not difficult and at last they
came to the edge of a forest
and stopped there to make camp and sleep until
morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>From branches of trees Cap’n Bill made a tiny house
that was just big enough for the little girl to crawl
into and lie down. But first they ate some of the
food Trot had carried in the basket.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want some, too?” she asked the Glass
Cat.</p>
<p>“No,” answered the creature.</p>
<p>“I suppose you’ll hunt around an’ catch a mouse,”
remarked Cap’n Bill.</p>
<p>“Me? Catch a mouse! Why should I do that?”
inquired the Glass Cat.</p>
<p>“Why, then you could eat it,” said the sailor-man.</p>
<p>“I beg to inform you,” returned the crystal tabby,
“that I do not eat mice. Being transparent, so anyone
can see through me, I’d look nice, wouldn’t I,
with a common mouse inside me? But the fact is
that I haven’t any stomach or other machinery that
would permit me to eat things. The careless magician
who made me didn’t think I’d need to eat, I
suppose.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you ever get hungry or thirsty?” asked
Trot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>“Never. I don’t complain, you know, at the way
I’m made, for I’ve never yet seen any living thing
as beautiful as I am. I have the handsomest brains
in the world. They’re pink, and you can see ’em
work.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="339" src="images/i101.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i101.jpg">
</div>
<p>“I wonder,” said Trot thoughtfully, as she ate her
bread and jam, “if <i>my</i> brains whirl around in the
same way yours do.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>“No; not the same way, surely,” returned the Glass
Cat; “for, in that case, they’d be as good as <i>my</i> brains,
except that they’re hidden under a thick, boney skull.”</p>
<p>“Brains,” remarked Cap’n Bill, “is of all kinds and
work different ways. But I’ve noticed that them as
thinks that their brains is best is often mistook.”</p>
<p>Trot was a little disturbed by sounds from the forest,
that night, for many beasts seemed prowling
among the trees, but she was confident Cap’n Bill
would protect her from harm. And in fact, no beast
ventured from the forest to attack them.</p>
<p>At daybreak they were up again, and after a simple
breakfast Cap’n Bill said to the Glass Cat:</p>
<p>“Up anchor, Mate, and let’s forge ahead. I don’t
suppose we’re far from that Magic Flower, are we?”</p>
<p>“Not far,” answered the transparent one, as it led
the way into the forest, “but it may take you some
time to get to it.”</p>
<p>Before long they reached the bank of a river. It
was not very wide, at this place, but as they followed
the banks in a northerly direction it gradually
broadened.</p>
<p>Suddenly the blue-green leaves of the trees changed
to a purple hue, and Trot noticed this and said:</p>
<p>“I wonder what made the colors change like that?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>“It’s because we have left the Munchkin Country
and entered the Gillikin Country,” explained the Glass
Cat. “Also it’s a sign our journey is nearly ended.”</p>
<p>The river made a sudden turn, and after the travelers
had passed around the bend, they saw that the
stream had now become as broad as a small lake, and
in the center of the Lake they beheld a little island,
not more than fifty feet in extent, either way. Something
glittered in the middle of this tiny island, and
the Glass Cat paused on the bank and said:</p>
<p>“There is the gold flower-pot containing the Magic
Flower, which is very curious and beautiful. If you
can get to the island, your task is ended—except to
carry the thing home with you.”</p>
<p>Cap’n Bill looked at the broad expanse of water
and began to whistle a low, quavering tune. Trot
knew that the whistle meant that Cap’n Bill was
thinking, and the old sailor didn’t look at the island
as much as he looked at the trees upon the bank where
they stood. Presently he took from the big pocket
of his coat an axe-blade, wound in an old cloth to
keep the sharp edge from cutting his clothing. Then,
with a large pocket knife, he cut a small limb from
a tree and whittled it into a handle for his axe.</p>
<p>“Sit down, Trot,” he advised the girl, as he worked.
“I’ve got quite a job ahead of me now, for I’ve got
to build us a raft.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>“What do we need a raft for, Cap’n?”</p>
<p>“Why, to take us to the island. We can’t walk
under water, in the river bed, as the Glass Cat did,
so we must float atop the water.”</p>
<p>“Can you make a raft, Cap’n Bill?”</p>
<p>“O’ course, Trot, if you give me time.”</p>
<p>The little girl sat down on a log and gazed at the
Island of the Magic Flower. Nothing else seemed to
grow on the tiny isle. There was no tree, no shrub, no
grass, even, as far as she could make out from that
distance. But the gold pot glittered in the rays of
the sun, and Trot could catch glimpses of glowing
colors above it, as the Magic Flower changed from
one sort to another.</p>
<p>“When I was here before,” remarked the Glass
Cat, lazily reclining at the girl’s feet, “I saw two
Kalidahs on this very bank, where they had come
to drink.”</p>
<p>“What are Kalidahs?” asked the girl.</p>
<p>“The most powerful and ferocious beasts in all Oz.
This forest is their especial home, and so there are
few other beasts to be found except monkeys. The
monkeys are spry enough to keep out of the way of
the fierce Kalidahs, which attack all other animals
and often fight among themselves.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="687" src="images/i105.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i105.jpg">
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>“Did they try to fight you when you saw ’em?”
asked Trot, getting very much excited.</p>
<p>“Yes. They sprang upon me in an instant; but I
lay flat on the ground, so I wouldn’t get my legs
broken by the great weight of the beasts, and when
they tried to bite me I laughed at them and jeered
them until they were frantic with rage, for they nearly
broke their teeth on my hard glass. So, after a time,
they discovered they could not hurt me, and went
away. It was great fun.”</p>
<p>“I hope they don’t come here again to drink,—not
while we’re here, anyhow,” returned the girl, “for
I’m not made of glass, nor is Cap’n Bill, and if those
bad beasts bit us, we’d get hurt.”</p>
<p>Cap’n Bill was cutting from the trees some long
stakes, making them sharp at one end and leaving a
crotch at the other end. These were to bind the logs
of his raft together. He had fashioned several and
was just finishing another when the Glass Cat cried:
“Look out! There’s a Kalidah coming toward us.”</p>
<p>Trot jumped up, greatly frightened, and looked at
the terrible animal as if fascinated by its fierce eyes,
for the Kalidah was looking at her, too, and its look
wasn’t at all friendly. But Cap’n Bill called to her:
“Wade into the river, Trot, up to your knees—an’
stay there!” and she obeyed him at once. The sailor-man
hobbled forward, the stake in one hand and his
axe in the other, and got between the girl and the
beast, which sprang upon him with a growl of defiance.</p>

<p>Cap’n Bill moved pretty slowly, sometimes, but now
he was quick as could be. As the Kalidah sprang
toward him he stuck out his wooden leg and the point
of it struck the beast between its eyes and sent it
rolling upon the ground. Before it could get upon
its feet again the sailor pushed the sharp stake right
through its body and then with the flat side of the
axe he hammered the stake as far into the ground as
it would go. By this means he captured the great
beast and made it harmless, for try as it would, it
could not get away from the stake that held it.</p>
<p>Cap’n Bill knew he could not kill the Kalidah, for
no living thing in Oz can be killed, so he stood back
and watched the beast wriggle and growl and paw
the earth with its sharp claws, and then, satisfied it
could not escape, he told Trot to come out of the water
again and dry her wet shoes and stockings in the
sun.</p>
<p>“Are you sure he can’t get away?” she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>“I’d bet a cookie on it,” said Cap’n Bill, so Trot
came ashore and took off her shoes and stockings and
laid them on the log to dry, while the sailor-man
resumed his work on the raft.</p>
<p>The Kalidah, realizing after many struggles that
it could not escape, now became quiet, but it said in
a harsh, snarling voice:</p>
<p>“I suppose you think you’re clever, to pin me to
the ground in this manner. But when my friends,
the other Kalidahs, come here, they’ll tear you to
pieces for treating me this way.”</p>
<p>“P’raps,” remarked Cap’n Bill, coolly, as he chopped
at the logs, “an’ p’raps not. When are your folks
comin’ here?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” admitted the Kalidah. “But when
they <i>do</i> come, you can’t escape them.”</p>
<p>“If they hold off long enough, I’ll have my raft
ready,” said Cap’n Bill.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with a raft?” inquired
the beast.</p>
<p>“We’re goin’ over to that island, to get the Magic
Flower.”</p>
<p>The huge beast looked at him in surprise a moment,
and then it began to laugh. The laugh was a good
deal like a roar, and it had a cruel and derisive sound,
but it was a laugh nevertheless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>“Good!” said the Kalidah. “Good! Very good!
I’m glad you’re going to get the Magic Flower. But
what will you do with it?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to take it to Ozma, as a present on
her birthday.”</p>
<p>The Kalidah laughed again; then it became sober.
“If you get to the land on your raft before my people
can catch you,” it said, “you will be safe from us.
We can swim like ducks, so the girl couldn’t have
escaped me by getting into the water; but Kalidahs
don’t go to that island over there.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked Trot.</p>
<p>The beast was silent.</p>
<p>“Tell us the reason,” urged Cap’n Bill.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s the Isle of the Magic Flower,” answered
the Kalidah, “and we don’t care much for magic. If
you hadn’t had a magic leg, instead of a meat one, you
couldn’t have knocked me over so easily and stuck
this wooden pin through me.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been to the Magic Isle,” said the Glass Cat,
“and I’ve watched the Magic Flower bloom, and I’m
sure it’s too pretty to be left in that lonely place where
only beasts prowl around it and no one else sees it.
So we’re going to take it away to the Emerald City.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>“I don’t care,” the beast replied in a surly tone.
“We Kalidahs would be just as contented if there
wasn’t a flower in our forest. What good are the
things anyhow?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you like pretty things?” asked Trot.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You ought to admire my pink brains, anyhow,”
declared the Glass Cat. “They’re beautiful and you
can see ’em work.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="292" src="images/i111.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i111.jpg">
</div>
<p>The beast only growled in reply, and Cap’n Bill,
having now cut all his logs to a proper size, began
to roll them to the water’s edge and fasten them
together.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER 10</p>
<p>The day was nearly gone
when, at last, the raft was
ready.</p>
<p>“It ain’t so very big,” said
the old sailor, “but I don’t
weigh much, an’ you, Trot,
don’t weigh half as much as I
do, an’ the glass pussy don’t
count.”</p>
<p>“But it’s safe, isn’t it?”
inquired the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>“Yes; it’s good enough to
carry us to the island an’
back again, an’ that’s about all we can expect of it.”</p>
<p>Saying this, Cap’n Bill pushed the raft into the
water, and when it was afloat, stepped upon it and
held out his hand to Trot, who quickly followed him.
The Glass Cat boarded the raft last of all.</p>
<p>The sailor had cut a long pole, and had also whittled
a flat paddle, and with these he easily propelled the
raft across the river. As they approached the island,
the Wonderful Flower became more plainly visible,
and they quickly decided that the Glass Cat had not
praised it too highly. The colors of the flowers that
bloomed in quick succession were strikingly bright
and beautiful, and the shapes of the blossoms were
varied and curious. Indeed, they did not resemble
ordinary flowers at all.</p>
<p>So intently did Trot and Cap’n Bill gaze upon the
Golden Flower pot that held the Magic Flower that
they scarcely noticed the island itself until the raft
beached upon its sands. But then the girl exclaimed:
“How funny it is, Cap’n Bill, that nothing else grows
here excep’ the Magic Flower.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Then the sailor glanced at the island and saw that
it was all bare ground, without a weed, a stone or a
blade of grass. Trot, eager to examine the Flower
closer, sprang from the raft and ran up the bank until
she reached the Golden Flowerpot. Then she stood
beside it motionless and filled with wonder. Cap’n
Bill joined her, coming more leisurely, and he, too,
stood in silent admiration for a time.</p>
<p>“Ozma will like this,” remarked the Glass Cat,
sitting down to watch the shifting hues of the flowers.
“I’m sure she won’t have as fine a birthday present
from anyone else.”</p>
<p>“Do you s’pose it’s very heavy, Cap’n? And can
we get it home without breaking it?” asked Trot
anxiously.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve lifted many bigger things than that,”
he replied; “but let’s see what it weighs.”</p>
<p>He tried to take a step forward, but could not
lift his meat foot from the ground. His wooden
leg seemed free enough, but the other would not
budge.</p>
<p>“I seem stuck, Trot,” he said, with a perplexed
look at his foot. “It ain’t mud, an’ it ain’t glue, but
somethin’s holdin’ me down.”</p>
<p>The girl attempted to lift her own feet, to go nearer
to her friend, but the ground held them as fast as it
held Cap’n Bill’s foot. She tried to slide them, or to
twist them around, but it was no use; she could not
move either foot a hair’s breadth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>“This is funny!” she exclaimed. “What do you
’spose has happened to us, Cap’n Bill?”</p>
<p>“I’m tryin’ to make out,” he answered. “Take off
your shoes, Trot. P’raps it’s the leather soles that’s
stuck to the ground.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="320" src="images/i115.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i115.jpg">
</div>
<p>She leaned down and unlaced her shoes, but found
she could not pull her feet out of them. The Glass
Cat, which was walking around as naturally as ever,
now said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>“Your foot has got roots to it, Cap’n, and I can see
the roots going into the ground, where they spread
out in all directions. It’s the same way with Trot.
That’s why you can’t move. The roots hold you fast.”</p>
<p>Cap’n Bill was rather fat and couldn’t see his own
feet very well, but he squatted down and examined
Trot’s feet and decided that the Glass Cat was right.</p>
<p>“This is hard luck,” he declared, in a voice that
showed he was uneasy at the discovery. “We’re
pris’ners, Trot, on this funny island, an’ I’d like to
know how we’re ever goin’ to get loose, so’s we can
get home again.”</p>
<p>“Now I know why the Kalidah laughed at us,” said
the girl, “and why he said none of the beasts ever came
to this island. The horrid creature knew we’d be
caught, and wouldn’t warn us.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Kalidah, although pinned fast
to the earth by Cap’n Bill’s stake, was facing the
island, and now the ugly expression which passed
over its face when it defied and sneered at Cap’n Bill
and Trot, had changed to one of amusement and curiosity.
When it saw the adventurers had actually
reached the island and were standing beside the Magic
Flower, it heaved a breath of satisfaction—a long,
deep breath that swelled the deep chest until the
beast could feel the stake that held him move a little,
as if withdrawing itself from the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>“Ah ha!” murmured the Kalidah, “a little more
of this will set me free and allow me to escape!”</p>
<p>So he began breathing as hard as he could, puffing
out his chest as much as possible with each indrawing
breath, and by doing this he managed to raise the
stake with each powerful breath, until at last the
Kalidah—using the muscles of his four legs as well
as his deep breaths—found itself free of the sandy
soil. The stake was sticking right through him, however,
so he found a rock deeply set in the bank and
pressed the sharp point of the stake upon the surface
of this rock until he had driven it clear through his
body. Then, by getting the stake tangled among some
thorny bushes, and wiggling his body, he managed
to draw it out altogether.</p>
<p>“There!” he exclaimed, “except for those two holes
in me, I’m as good as ever; but I must admit that
that old wooden-legged fellow saved both himself and
the girl by making me a prisoner.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Now the Kalidahs, although the most disagreeable
creatures in the Land of Oz, were nevertheless magical
inhabitants of a magical Fairyland, and in their
natures a certain amount of good was mingled with
the evil. This one was not very revengeful, and now
that his late foes were in danger of perishing, his
anger against them faded away.</p>
<p>“Our own Kalidah King,” he reflected, “has certain
magical powers of his own. Perhaps he knows
how to fill up these two holes in my body.”</p>
<p>So without paying any more attention to Trot and
Cap’n Bill than they were paying to him, he entered
the forest and trotted along a secret path that led
to the hidden lair of all the Kalidahs.</p>
<p>While the Kalidah was making good its escape
Cap’n Bill took his pipe from his pocket and filled it
with tobacco and lighted it. Then, as he puffed out
the smoke, he tried to think what could be done.</p>
<p>“The Glass Cat seems all right,” he said, “an’ my
wooden leg didn’t take roots and grow, either. So
it’s only flesh that gets caught.”</p>
<p>“It’s magic that does it, Cap’n!”</p>
<p>“I know, Trot, and that’s what sticks me. We’re
livin’ in a magic country, but neither of us knows
any magic an’ so we can’t help ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t the Wizard of Oz help us—or Glinda
the Good?” asked the little girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>“Ah, now we’re beginnin’ to reason,” he answered.
“I’d probably thought o’ that, myself, in a minute
more. By good luck the Glass Cat is free, an’ so it
can run back to the Emerald City an’ tell the Wizard
about our fix, an’ ask him to come an’ help us get
loose.”</p>
<p>“Will you go?” Trot asked the cat, speaking very
earnestly.</p>
<p>“I’m no messenger, to be sent here and there,”
asserted the curious animal in a sulky tone of voice.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Cap’n Bill, “you’ve got to go home,
anyhow, ’cause you don’t want to stay here, I take it.
And, when you get home, it wouldn’t worry you much
to tell the Wizard what’s happened to us.”</p>
<p>“That’s true,” said the cat, sitting on its haunches
and lazily washing its face with one glass paw. “I
don’t mind telling the Wizard—when I get home.”</p>
<p>“Won’t you go now?” pleaded Trot. “We don’t
want to stay here any longer than we can help, and
everybody in Oz will be interested in you, and call
you a hero, and say nice things about you because
you helped your friends out of trouble.”</p>
<p>That was the best way to manage the Glass Cat,
which was so vain that it loved to be praised.</p>
<p>“I’m going home right away,” said the creature,
“and I’ll tell the Wizard to come and help you.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Saying this, it walked down to the water and disappeared
under the surface. Not being able to manage
the raft alone, the Glass Cat walked on the bottom
of the river as it had done when it visited the island
before, and soon they saw it appear on the farther
bank and trot into the forest, where it was quickly
lost to sight among the trees.</p>
<p>Then Trot heaved a deep sigh.</p>
<p>“Cap’n,” said she, “we’re in a bad fix. There’s
nothing here to eat, and we can’t even lie down to sleep.
Unless the Glass Cat hurries, and the Wizard hurries,
I don’t know what’s going to become of us!”</p>

<h2 id="c11">The Beasts of the Forest of Gugu</h2>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="675" src="images/i121.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i121.jpg">
</div>
<p class="center">CHAPTER 11</p>
<p>That was a wonderful gathering
of wild animals in the
Forest of Gugu next sunrise.
Rango, the Gray Ape, had
even called his monkey sentinels
away from the forest
edge, and every beast, little
and big, was in the great
clearing where meetings were
held on occasions of great
importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>In the center of the clearing
stood a great shelving rock,
having a flat, inclined surface, and on this sat the
stately Leopard Gugu, who was King of the Forest.
On the ground beneath him squatted Bru the Bear,
Loo the Unicorn, and Rango the Gray Ape, the King’s
three Counsellors, and in front of them stood the two
strange beasts who had called themselves Li-Mon-Eags,
but were really the transformations of Ruggedo
the Nome, and Kiki Aru the Hyup.</p>
<p>Then came the beasts—rows and rows and rows
of them! The smallest beasts were nearest the King’s
rock throne; then there were wolves and foxes, lynxes
and hyenas, and the like; behind them were gathered
the monkey tribes, who were hard to keep in
order because they teased the other animals and were
full of mischievous tricks. Back of the monkeys were
the pumas, jaguars, tigers and lions, and their kind;
next the bears, all sizes and colors; after them bisons,
wild asses, zebras and unicorns; farther on the rhinoceri
and hippopotami, and at the far edge of the
forest, close to the trees that shut in the clearing, was
a row of thick-skinned elephants, still as statues but
with eyes bright and intelligent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Many other kinds of beasts, too numerous to mention,
were there, and some were unlike any beasts we
see in the menageries and zoos in our country. Some
were from the mountains west of the forest, and some
from the plains at the east, and some from the river;
but all present acknowledged the leadership of Gugu,
who for many years had ruled them wisely and forced
all to obey the laws.</p>
<p>When the beasts had taken their places in the
clearing and the rising sun was shooting its first
bright rays over the treetops, King Gugu rose on his
throne. The Leopard’s giant form, towering above
all the others, caused a sudden hush to fall on the
assemblage.</p>
<p>“Brothers,” he said in his deep voice, “a stranger
has come among us, a beast of curious form who is a
great magician and is able to change the shapes of
men or beasts at his will. This stranger has come to
us, with another of his kind, from out of the sky,
to warn us of a danger which threatens us all, and to
offer us a way to escape from that danger. He says
he is our friend, and he has proved to me and to my
counsellors his magic powers. Will you listen to what
he has to say to you—to the message he has brought
from the sky?”</p>
<p>“Let him speak!” came in a great roar from the
great company of assembled beasts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="693" src="images/i124.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i124.jpg">

<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="686" src="images/i125.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i125.jpg">
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>So Ruggedo the Nome sprang upon the flat rock
beside Gugu the King, and another roar, gentle this
time, showed how astonished the beasts were at the
sight of his curious form. His lion’s face was surrounded
by a mane of pure white hair; his eagle’s
wings were attached to the shoulders of his monkey
body and were so long that they nearly touched the
ground; he had powerful arms and legs in addition
to the wings, and at the end of his long, strong tail
was a golden ball. Never had any beast beheld such
a curious creature before, and so the very sight of
the stranger, who was said to be a great magician,
filled all present with awe and wonder.</p>
<p>Kiki stayed down below and, half hidden by the
shelf of rock, was scarcely noticed. The boy realized
that the old Nome was helpless without his magic
power, but he also realized that Ruggedo was the
best talker. So he was willing the Nome should take
the lead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>“Beasts of the Forest of Gugu,” began Ruggedo
the Nome, “my comrade and I are your friends. We
are magicians, and from our home in the sky we can
look down into the Land of Oz and see everything
that is going on. Also we can hear what the people
below us are saying. That is how we heard Ozma,
who rules the Land of Oz, say to her people: ‘The
beasts in the Forest of Gugu are lazy and are of no
use to us. Let us go to their forest and make them
all our prisoners. Let us tie them with ropes, and
beat them with sticks, until they work for us and
become our willing slaves.’ And when the people
heard Ozma of Oz say this, they were glad and raised
a great shout and said: ‘We will do it! We will
make the beasts of the Forest of Gugu our slaves!’”</p>
<p>The wicked old Nome could say no more, just then,
for such a fierce roar of anger rose from the multitude
of beasts that his voice was drowned by the
clamor. Finally the roar died away, like distant
thunder, and Ruggedo the Nome went on with his
speech.</p>
<p>“Having heard the Oz people plot against your
liberty, we watched to see what they would do, and
saw them all begin making ropes—ropes long and
short—with which to snare our friends the beasts.
You are angry, but we also were angry, for when the
Oz people became the enemies of the beasts they also
became our enemies; for we, too, are beasts, although
we live in the sky. And my comrade and I said: ‘We
will save our friends and have revenge on the Oz
people,’ and so we came here to tell you of your
danger and of our plan to save you.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>“We can save ourselves,” cried an old elephant.
“We can fight.”</p>
<p>“The Oz people are fairies, and you can’t fight
against magic unless you also have magic,” answered
the Nome.</p>
<p>“Tell us your plan!” shouted the huge Tiger, and
the other beasts echoed his words, crying: “Tell us
your plan.”</p>
<p>“My plan is simple,” replied Ruggedo. “By our
magic we will transform all you animals into men
and women—like the Oz people—and we will transform
all the Oz people into beasts. You can then live
in the fine houses of the Land of Oz, and eat the fine
food of the Oz people, and wear their fine clothes,
and sing and dance and be happy. And the Oz people,
having become beasts, will have to live here in the
forest and hunt and fight for food, and often go hungry,
as you now do, and have no place to sleep but
a bed of leaves or a hole in the ground. Having become
men and women, you beasts will have all the comforts
you desire, and having become beasts, the Oz
people will be very miserable. That is our plan, and
if you agree to it, we will all march at once into the
Land of Oz and quickly conquer our enemies.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>When the stranger ceased speaking, a great silence
fell on the assemblage, for the beasts were thinking
of what he had said. Finally one of the walrus asked:</p>
<p>“Can you really transform beasts into men, and
men into beasts?”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="340" src="images/i129.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i129.jpg">
</div>
<p>“He can—he can!” cried Loo the Unicorn, prancing
up and down in an excited manner. “He transformed
<i>me</i>, only last evening, and he can transform
us all.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Gugu the King now stepped forward.</p>
<p>“You have heard the stranger speak,” said he, “and
now you must answer him. It is for you to decide.
Shall we agree to this plan, or not?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” shouted some of the animals.</p>
<p>“No!” shouted others.</p>
<p>And some were yet silent.</p>
<p>Gugu looked around the great circle.</p>
<p>“Take more time to think,” he suggested. “Your
answer is very important. Up to this time we have
had no trouble with the Oz people, but we are proud
and free, and never will become slaves. Think carefully,
and when you are ready to answer, I will hear
you.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>

</div>
<p class="center">CHAPTER 12</p>
<p>Then arose a great confusion
of sounds as all the animals
began talking to their fellows.
The monkeys chattered and
the bears growled and the
voices of the jaguars and lions
rumbled, and the wolves
yelped and the elephants had
to trumpet loudly to make
their voices heard. Such a
hubbub had never been known
in the forest before, and each
beast argued with his neighbor
until it seemed the noise would never cease.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Ruggedo the Nome waved his arms and fluttered
his wings to try to make them listen to him again,
but the beasts paid no attention. Some wanted to
fight the Oz people, some wanted to be transformed,
and some wanted to do nothing at all.</p>
<p>The growling and confusion had grown greater than
ever when in a flash silence fell on all the beasts present,
the arguments were hushed, and all gazed in
astonishment at a strange sight.</p>
<p>For into the circle strode a great Lion—bigger and
more powerful than any other lion there—and on
his back rode a little girl who smiled fearlessly at the
multitude of beasts. And behind the lion and the
little girl came another beast—a monstrous Tiger,
who bore upon his back a funny little man carrying
a black bag. Right past the rows of wondering beasts
the strange animals walked, advancing until they
stood just before the rock throne of Gugu.</p>
<p>Then the little girl and the funny little man dismounted,
and the great Lion demanded in a loud voice:</p>
<p>“Who is King in this forest?”</p>
<p>“I am!” answered Gugu, looking steadily at the
other. “I am Gugu the Leopard, and I am King of
this forest.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>“Then I greet Your Majesty with great respect,”
said the Lion. “Perhaps you have heard of me, Gugu.
I am called the ‘Cowardly Lion,’ and I am King of
all Beasts, the world over.”</p>
<p>Gugu’s eyes flashed angrily.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said he, “I have heard of you. You have
long claimed to be King of Beasts, but no beast who
is a coward can be King over me.”</p>
<p>“He isn’t a coward, Your Majesty,” asserted the
little girl, “he’s just cowardly, that’s all.”</p>
<p>Gugu looked at her. All the other beasts were looking
at her, too.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” asked the King.</p>
<p>“Me? Oh, I’m just Dorothy,” she answered.</p>
<p>“How dare you come here?” demanded the King.</p>
<p>“Why, I’m not afraid to go anywhere, if the Cowardly
Lion is with me,” she said. “I know him pretty
well, and so I can trust him. He’s always afraid,
when we get into trouble, and that’s why he’s cowardly;
but he’s a terrible fighter, and that’s why he
isn’t a coward. He doesn’t like to fight, you know,
but when he <i>has</i> to, there isn’t any beast living that
can conquer him.”</p>
<p>Gugu the King looked at the big, powerful form of
the Cowardly Lion, and knew she spoke the truth.
Also the other Lions of the forest now came forward
and bowed low before the strange Lion.</p>

<p>“We welcome Your Majesty,” said one. “We have
known you many years ago, before you went to live
at the Emerald City, and we have seen you fight the
terrible Kalidahs and conquer them, so we know you
are the King of all Beasts.”</p>
<p>“It is true,” replied the Cowardly Lion; “but I did
not come here to rule the beasts of this forest. Gugu
is King here, and I believe he is a good King and just
and wise. I come, with my friends, to be the guest
of Gugu, and I hope we are welcome.”</p>
<p>That pleased the great Leopard, who said very
quickly:</p>
<p>“Yes; you, at least, are welcome to my forest. But
who are these strangers with you.”</p>
<p>“Dorothy has introduced herself,” replied the Lion,
“and you are sure to like her when you know her
better. This man is the Wizard of Oz, a friend of
mine who can do wonderful tricks of magic. And
here is my true and tried friend, the Hungry Tiger,
who lives with me in the Emerald City.”</p>
<p>“Is he <i>always</i> hungry?” asked Loo the Unicorn.</p>
<p>“I am,” replied the Tiger, answering the question
himself. “I am always hungry for fat babies.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>“Can’t you find any fat babies in Oz to eat?”
inquired Loo, the Unicorn.</p>
<p>“There are plenty of them, of course,” said the
Tiger, “but unfortunately I have such a tender conscience
that it won’t allow me to eat babies. So I’m
always hungry for ’em and never can eat ’em, because
my conscience won’t let me.”</p>
<p>Now of all the surprised beasts in that clearing,
not one was so much surprised at the sudden appearance
of these four strangers as Ruggedo the Nome.
He was frightened, too, for he recognized them as his
most powerful enemies; but he also realized that they
could not know he was the former King of the Nomes,
because of the beast’s form he wore, which disguised
him so effectually. So he took courage and resolved
that the Wizard and Dorothy should not defeat his
plans.</p>
<p>It was hard to tell, just yet, what the vast assemblage
of beasts thought of the new arrivals. Some
glared angrily at them, but more of them seemed to
be curious and wondering. All were interested, however,
and they kept very quiet and listened carefully
to all that was said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Kiki Aru, who had remained unnoticed in the
shadow of the rock, was at first more alarmed by
the coming of the strangers than even Ruggedo was,
and the boy told himself that unless he acted quickly
and without waiting to ask the advice of the old Nome,
their conspiracy was likely to be discovered and all
their plans to conquer and rule Oz be defeated. Kiki
didn’t like the way Ruggedo acted either, for the
former King of the Nomes wanted to do everything
his own way, and made the boy, who alone possessed
the power of transformations, obey his orders as if
he were a slave.</p>
<p>Another thing that disturbed Kiki Aru was the fact
that a real Wizard had arrived, who was said to possess
many magical powers, and this Wizard carried
his tools in a black bag, and was the friend of the Oz
people, and so would probably try to prevent war
between the beasts of the forest and the people
of Oz.</p>
<p>All these things passed through the mind of the
Hyup boy while the Cowardly Lion and Gugu the
King were talking together, and that was why he
now began to do several strange things.</p>
<p>He had found a place, near to the point where he
stood, where there was a deep hollow in the rock, so
he put his face into this hollow and whispered softly,
so he would not be heard:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>“I want the Wizard of Oz to become a fox—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!”</p>
<p>The Wizard, who had stood smilingly beside his
friends, suddenly felt his form change to that of a
fox, and his black bag fell to the ground. Kiki reached
out an arm and seized the bag, and the Fox cried as
loud as it could:</p>
<p>“Treason! There’s a traitor here with magic
powers!”</p>
<p>Everyone was startled at this cry, and Dorothy,
seeing her old friend’s plight, screamed and exclaimed:
“Mercy me!”</p>
<p>But the next instant the little girl’s form had
changed to that of a lamb with fleecy white wool, and
Dorothy was too bewildered to do anything but look
around her in wonder.</p>
<p>The Cowardly Lion’s eyes now flashed fire; he
crouched low and lashed the ground with his tail and
gazed around to discover who the treacherous magician
might be. But Kiki, who had kept his face in the
hollow rock, again whispered the magic word, and the
great lion disappeared and in his place stood a little
boy dressed in Munchkin costume. The little Munchkin
boy was as angry as the lion had been, but he was
small and helpless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Ruggedo the Nome saw what was happening and
was afraid Kiki would spoil all his plans, so he leaned
over the rock and shouted: “Stop, Kiki—stop!”</p>
<p>Kiki would not stop, however. Instead, he transformed
the Nome into a goose, to Ruggedo’s horror
and dismay. But the Hungry Tiger had witnessed
all these transformations, and he was watching to see
which of those present was to blame for them. When
Ruggedo spoke to Kiki, the Hungry Tiger knew that
he was the magician, so he made a sudden spring and
hurled his great body full upon the form of the
Li-Mon-Eag crouching against the rock. Kiki didn’t
see the Tiger coming because his face was still in the
hollow, and the heavy body of the tiger bore him to
the earth just as he said “<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl!</span>” for the fifth
time.</p>
<p>So now the tiger which was crushing him changed
to a rabbit, and relieved of its weight, Kiki sprang
up and, spreading his eagle’s wings, flew into the
branches of a tree, where no beast could easily reach
him. He was not an instant too quick in doing this,
for Gugu the King had crouched on the rock’s edge
and was about to spring on the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>From his tree Kiki transformed Gugu into a fat
Gillikin woman, and laughed aloud to see how the
woman pranced with rage, and how astonished all the
beasts were at their King’s new shape.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="333" src="images/i141.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i141.jpg">
</div>
<p>The beasts were frightened, too, fearing they would
share the fate of Gugu, so a stampede began when
Rango the Gray Ape sprang into the forest, and Bru
the Bear and Loo the Unicorn followed as quickly as
they could. The elephants backed into the forest,
and all the other animals, big and little, rushed after
them, scattering through the jungles until the clearing
was far behind. The monkeys scrambled into the
trees and swung themselves from limb to limb, to
avoid being trampled upon by the bigger beasts, and
they were so quick that they distanced all the rest.
A panic of fear seemed to have overtaken the forest
people and they got as far away from the terrible
Magician as they possibly could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="326" src="images/i142.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i142.jpg">
</div>
<p>But the transformed ones stayed in the clearing,
being so astonished and bewildered by their new
shapes that they could only look at one another in a
dazed and helpless fashion, although each one was
greatly annoyed at the trick that had been played on
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>“Who are you?” the Munchkin boy asked the Rabbit;
and “Who are you?” the Fox asked the Lamb;
and “Who are you?” the Rabbit asked the fat Gillikin
woman.</p>
<p>“I’m Dorothy,” said the woolly Lamb.</p>
<p>“I’m the Wizard,” said the Fox.</p>
<p>“I’m the Cowardly Lion,” said the Munchkin Boy.</p>
<p>“I’m the Hungry Tiger,” said the Rabbit.</p>
<p>“I’m Gugu the King,” said the fat Woman.</p>
<p>But when they asked the Goose who he was, Ruggedo
the Nome would not tell them.</p>
<p>“I’m just a Goose,” he replied, “and what I was
before, I cannot remember.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<h2 id="c13">The Loss of the Black Bag</h2>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="679" src="images/i144.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i144.jpg">
</div>
<p class="center">CHAPTER 13</p>
<p>Kiki Aru, in the form of the
Li-Mon-Eag, had scrambled
into the high, thick branches
of the tree, so no one could
see him, and there he opened
the Wizard’s black bag, which
he had carried away in his
flight. He was curious to see
what the Wizard’s magic tools
looked like, and hoped he
could use some of them and
so secure more power; but
after he had taken the articles,
one by one, from the bag, he had to admit they
were puzzles to him. For, unless he understood their
uses, they were of no value whatever. Kiki Aru, the
Hyup boy, was no wizard or magician at all, and could
do nothing unusual except to use the Magic Word
he had stolen from his father on Mount Munch. So
he hung the Wizard’s black bag on a branch of the
tree and then climbed down to the lower limbs that
he might see what the victims of his transformations
were doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>They were all on top of the flat rock, talking together
in tones so low that Kiki could not hear what they
said.</p>
<p>“This is certainly a misfortune,” remarked the
Wizard in the Fox’s form, “but our transformations
are a sort of enchantment which is very easy to break—when
you know how and have the tools to do it
with. The tools are in my Black Bag; but where is
the Bag?”</p>
<p>No one knew that, for none had seen Kiki Aru fly
away with it.</p>
<p>“Let’s look and see if we can find it,” suggested
Dorothy the Lamb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>So they left the rock, and all of them searched the
clearing high and low without finding the Bag of
Magic Tools. The Goose searched as earnestly as the
others, for if he could discover it, he meant to hide
it where the Wizard could never find it, because if
the Wizard changed him back to his proper form,
along with the others, he would then be recognized
as Ruggedo the Nome, and they would send him out
of the Land of Oz and so ruin all his hopes of
conquest.</p>
<p>Ruggedo was not really sorry, now that he thought
about it, that Kiki had transformed all these Oz folks.
The forest beasts, it was true, had been so frightened
that they would now never consent to be transformed
into men, but Kiki could transform them against their
will, and once they were all in human forms, it would
not be impossible to induce them to conquer the Oz
people.</p>
<p>So all was not lost, thought the old Nome, and the
best thing for him to do was to rejoin the Hyup boy
who had the secret of the transformations. So, having
made sure the Wizard’s black bag was not in the
clearing, the Goose wandered away through the trees
when the others were not looking, and when out of
their hearing, he began calling, “Kiki Aru! Kiki
Aru! Quack—quack! Kiki Aru!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>The Boy and the Woman, the Fox, the Lamb and
the Rabbit, not being able to find the bag, went back
to the rock, all feeling exceedingly strange.</p>
<p>“Where’s the Goose?” asked the Wizard.</p>
<p>“He must have run away,” replied Dorothy. “I
wonder who he was?”</p>
<p>“I think,” said Gugu the King, who was the fat
Woman, “that the Goose was the stranger who proposed
that we make war upon the Oz people. If so,
his transformation was merely a trick to deceive us,
and he has now gone to join his comrade, that wicked
Li-Mon-Eag who obeyed all his commands.”</p>
<p>“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy. “Shall
we go back to the Emerald City, as we are, and then
visit Glinda the Good and ask her to break the
enchantments?”</p>
<p>“I think so,” replied the Wizard Fox. “And we
can take Gugu the King with us, and have Glinda
restore him to his natural shape. But I hate to leave
my bag of Magic Tools behind me, for without it I
shall lose much of my power as a Wizard. Also, if
I go back to the Emerald City in the shape of a Fox,
the Oz people will think I’m a poor Wizard and will
lose their respect for me.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>“Let us make still another search for your tools,”
suggested the Cowardly Lion, “and then, if we fail
to find the Black Bag anywhere in this forest, we must
go back home as we are.”</p>
<p>“Why did you come here, anyway?” inquired Gugu.</p>
<p>“We wanted to borrow a dozen monkeys, to use on
Ozma’s birthday,” explained the Wizard. “We were
going to make them small, and train them to do tricks,
and put them inside Ozma’s birthday cake.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said the Forest King, “you would have to
get the consent of Rango the Gray Ape, to do that.
He commands all the tribes of monkeys.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it’s too late, now,” said Dorothy, regretfully.
“It was a splendid plan, but we’ve got troubles
of our own, and I don’t like being a lamb at all.”</p>
<p>“You’re nice and fuzzy,” said the Cowardly Lion.</p>
<p>“That’s nothing,” declared Dorothy. “I’ve never
been ’specially proud of myself, but I’d rather be the
way I was born than anything else in the whole
world.”</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>The Glass Cat, although it had some disagreeable
ways and manners, nevertheless realized that Trot
and Cap’n Bill were its friends and so was quite disturbed
at the fix it had gotten them into by leading
them to the Isle of the Magic Flower. The ruby heart
of the Glass Cat was cold and hard, but still it was
a heart, and to have a heart of any sort is to have some
consideration for others. But the queer transparent
creature didn’t want Trot and Cap’n Bill to know it
was sorry for them, and therefore it moved very slowly
until it had crossed the river and was out of sight
among the trees of the forest. Then it headed straight
toward the Emerald City, and trotted so fast that it
was like a crystal streak crossing the valleys and
plains. Being glass, the cat was tireless, and with
no reason to delay its journey, it reached Ozma’s
palace in wonderfully quick time.</p>
<p>“Where’s the Wizard?” it asked the Pink Kitten,
which was curled up in the sunshine on the lowest
step of the palace entrance.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother me,” lazily answered the Pink Kitten,
whose name was Eureka.</p>
<p>“I must find the Wizard at once!” said the Glass
Cat.</p>
<p>“Then find him,” advised Eureka, and went to sleep
again.</p>
<p>The Glass Cat darted up the stairway and came
upon Toto, Dorothy’s little black dog.</p>
<p>“Where’s the Wizard?” asked the Cat.</p>
<p>“Gone on a journey with Dorothy,” replied Toto.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>“When did they go, and where have they gone?”
demanded the Cat.</p>
<p>“They went yesterday, and I heard them say they
would go to the Great Forest in the Munchkin
Country.”</p>
<p>“Dear me,” said the Glass Cat; “that is a long
journey.”</p>
<p>“But they rode on the Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly
Lion,” explained Toto, “and the Wizard carried
his Black Bag of Magic Tools.”</p>
<p>The Glass Cat knew the Great Forest of Gugu well,
for it had traveled through this forest many times in
its journeys through the Land of Oz. And it reflected
that the Forest of Gugu was nearer to the Isle of the
Magic Flower than the Emerald City was, and so, if it
could manage to find the Wizard, it could lead him
across the Gillikin country to where Trot and Cap’n
Bill were prisoned. It was a wild country and little
traveled, but the Glass Cat knew every path. So very
little time need be lost, after all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Without stopping to ask any more questions the Cat
darted out of the palace and away from the Emerald
City, taking the most direct route to the Forest of
Gugu. Again the creature flashed through the country
like a streak of light, and it would surprise you to
know how quickly it reached the edge of the Great
Forest.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="291" src="images/i151.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i151.jpg">
</div>
<p>There were no monkey guards among the trees to
cry out a warning, and this was so unusual that it
astonished the Glass Cat. Going farther into the
forest it presently came upon a wolf, which at first
bounded away in terror. But then, seeing it was only
a Glass Cat, the Wolf stopped, and the Cat could see
it was trembling, as if from a terrible fright.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the Cat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>“A dreadful Magician has come among us!”
exclaimed the Wolf, “and he’s changing the forms of
all the beasts—quick as a wink—and making them
all his slaves.”</p>
<p>The Glass Cat smiled and said:</p>
<p>“Why, that’s only the Wizard of Oz. He may be
having some fun with you forest people, but the
Wizard wouldn’t hurt a beast for anything.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean the Wizard,” explained the Wolf.
“And if the Wizard of Oz is that funny little man who
rode a great Tiger into the clearing, he’s been transformed
himself by the terrible Magician.”</p>
<p>“The Wizard transformed? Why, that’s impossible,”
declared the Glass Cat.</p>
<p>“No; it isn’t. I saw him with my own eyes, changed
into the form of a Fox, and the girl who was with him
was changed to a woolly Lamb.”</p>
<p>The Glass Cat was indeed surprised.</p>
<p>“When did that happen?” it asked.</p>
<p>“Just a little while ago in the clearing. All the
animals had met there, but they ran away when the
Magician began his transformations, and I’m thankful
I escaped with my natural shape. But I’m still afraid,
and I’m going somewhere to hide.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>With this the Wolf ran on, and the Glass Cat, which
knew where the big clearing was, went toward it. But
now it walked more slowly, and its pink brains rolled
and tumbled around at a great rate because it was
thinking over the amazing news the Wolf had told it.</p>
<p>When the Glass Cat reached the clearing, it saw a
Fox, a Lamb, a Rabbit, a Munchkin boy and a fat
Gillikin woman, all wandering around in an aimless
sort of way, for they were again searching for the
Black Bag of Magic Tools.</p>
<p>The Cat watched them a moment and then it walked
slowly into the open space. At once the Lamb ran
toward it, crying:</p>
<p>“Oh, Wizard, here’s the Glass Cat!”</p>
<p>“Where, Dorothy?” asked the Fox.</p>
<p>“Here!”</p>
<p>The Boy and the Woman and the Rabbit now joined
the Fox and the Lamb, and they all stood before the
Glass Cat and speaking together, almost like a chorus,
asked: “Have you seen the Black Bag?”</p>
<p>“Often,” replied the Glass Cat, “but not lately.”</p>
<p>“It’s lost,” said the Fox, “and we must find it.”</p>
<p>“Are you the Wizard?” asked the Cat.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And who are these others?”</p>
<p>“I’m Dorothy,” said the Lamb.</p>
<p>“I’m the Cowardly Lion,” said the Munchkin boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>“I’m the Hungry Tiger,” said the Rabbit.</p>
<p>“I’m Gugu, King of the Forest,” said the fat Woman.</p>
<p>The Glass Cat sat on its hind legs and began to
laugh. “My, what a funny lot!” exclaimed the Creature.
“Who played this joke on you?”</p>
<p>“It’s no joke at all,” declared the Wizard. “It was
a cruel, wicked transformation, and the Magician that
did it has the head of a lion, the body of a monkey, the
wings of an eagle and a round ball on the end of his
tail.”</p>
<p>The Glass Cat laughed again. “That Magician must
look funnier than you do,” it said. “Where is he
now?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere in the forest,” said the Cowardly Lion.
“He just jumped into that tall maple tree over there,
for he can climb like a monkey and fly like an eagle,
and then he disappeared in the forest.”</p>
<p>“And there was another Magician, just like him,
who was his friend,” added Dorothy, “but they probably
quarreled, for the wickedest one changed his
friend into the form of a Goose.”</p>
<p>“What became of the Goose?” asked the Cat, looking
around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>“He must have gone away to find his friend,”
answered Gugu the King. “But a Goose can’t travel
very fast, so we could easily find him if we wanted to.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="331" src="images/i155.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i155.jpg">
</div>
<p>“The worst thing of all,” said the Wizard, “is that
my Black Bag is lost. It disappeared when I was
transformed. If I could find it I could easily break
these enchantments by means of my magic, and we
would resume our own forms again. Will you help
us search for the Black Bag, Friend Cat?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>“Of course,” replied the Glass Cat. “But I expect
the strange Magician carried it away with him. If
he’s a magician, he knows you need that Bag, and
perhaps he’s afraid of your magic. So he’s probably
taken the Bag with him, and you won’t see it again
unless you find the Magician.”</p>
<p>“That sounds reasonable,” remarked the Lamb,
which was Dorothy. “Those pink brains of yours
seem to be working pretty well to-day.”</p>
<p>“If the Glass Cat is right,” said the Wizard in a
solemn voice, “there’s more trouble ahead of us. That
Magician is dangerous, and if we go near him he may
transform us into shapes not as nice as these.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see how we could be any <i>worse</i> off,” growled
Gugu, who was indignant because he was forced to
appear in the form of a fat woman.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” said the Cowardly Lion, “our best plan
is to find the Magician and try to get the Black Bag
from him. We may manage to steal it, or perhaps we
can argue him into giving it to us.”</p>
<p>“Why not find the Goose, first?” asked Dorothy.
“The Goose will be angry at the Magician, and he may
be able to help us.”</p>
<p>“That isn’t a bad idea,” returned the Wizard.
“Come on, Friends; let’s find that Goose. We will
separate and search in different directions, and the
first to find the Goose must bring him here, where we
will all meet again in an hour.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>

<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="678" src="images/i157.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i157.jpg">
</div>
<p class="center">CHAPTER 14</p>
<p>Now, the Goose was the
transformation of old Ruggedo,
who was at one time
King of the Nomes, and he
was even more angry at
Kiki Aru than were the
others whose shapes had been
changed. The Nome detested
anything in the way of a bird,
because birds lay eggs and
eggs are feared by all the
Nomes more than anything
else in the world. A goose is
a foolish bird, too, and Ruggedo was dreadfully
ashamed of the shape he was forced to wear. And it
would make him shudder to reflect that the Goose
might lay an egg!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>So the Nome was afraid of himself and afraid of
everything around him. If an egg touched him he
could then be destroyed, and almost any animal he
met in the forest might easily conquer him. And that
would be the end of old Ruggedo the Nome.</p>
<p>Aside from these fears, however, he was filled with
anger against Kiki, whom he had meant to trap by
cleverly stealing from him the Magic Word. The boy
must have been crazy to spoil everything the way he
did, but Ruggedo knew that the arrival of the Wizard
had scared Kiki, and he was not sorry the boy had
transformed the Wizard and Dorothy and made them
helpless. It was his own transformation that annoyed
him and made him indignant, so he ran about the
forest hunting for Kiki, so that he might get a better
shape and coax the boy to follow his plans to conquer
the Land of Oz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Kiki Aru hadn’t gone very far away, for he had
surprised himself as well as the others by the quick
transformations and was puzzled as to what to do next.
Ruggedo the Nome was overbearing and tricky, and
Kiki knew he was not to be depended on; but the Nome
could plan and plot, which the Hyup boy was not wise
enough to do, and so, when he looked down through
the branches of a tree and saw a Goose waddling along
below and heard it cry out, “Kiki Aru! Quack—quack!
Kiki Aru!” the boy answered in a low voice,
“Here I am,” and swung himself down to the lowest
limb of the tree.</p>
<p>The Goose looked up and saw him.</p>
<p>“You’ve bungled things in a dreadful way!” exclaimed
the Goose. “Why did you do it?”</p>
<p>“Because I wanted to,” answered Kiki. “You
acted as if I was your slave, and I wanted to show
these forest people that I am more powerful than
you.”</p>
<p>The Goose hissed softly, but Kiki did not hear that.</p>
<p>Old Ruggedo quickly recovered his wits and muttered
to himself: “This boy is the goose, although it
is I who wear the goose’s shape. I will be gentle with
him now, and fierce with him when I have him in my
power.” Then he said aloud to Kiki:</p>
<p>“Well, hereafter I will be content to acknowledge
you the master. You bungled things, as I said, but we
can still conquer Oz.”</p>
<p>“How?” asked the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>“First give me back the shape of the Li-Mon-Eag,
and then we can talk together more conveniently,”
suggested the Nome.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment, then,” said Kiki, and climbed
higher up the tree. There he whispered the Magic
Word and the Goose became a Li-Mon-Eag, as he had
been before.</p>
<p>“Good!” said the Nome, well pleased, as Kiki joined
him by dropping down from the tree. “Now let us
find a quiet place where we can talk without being
overheard by the beasts.”</p>
<p>So the two started away and crossed the forest until
they came to a place where the trees were not so tall
nor so close together, and among these scattered trees
was another clearing, not so large as the first one,
where the meeting of the beasts had been held. Standing
on the edge of this clearing and looking across it,
they saw the trees on the farther side full of monkeys,
who were chattering together at a great rate of the
sights they had witnessed at the meeting.</p>
<p>The old Nome whispered to Kiki not to enter the
clearing or allow the monkeys to see them.</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked the boy, drawing back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>“Because those monkeys are to be our army—the
army which will conquer Oz,” said the Nome. “Sit
down here with me, Kiki, and keep quiet, and I will
explain to you my plan.”</p>
<p>Now, neither Kiki Aru nor Ruggedo had noticed
that a sly Fox had followed them all the way from
the tree where the Goose had been transformed to the
Li-Mon-Eag. Indeed, this Fox, who was none other
than the Wizard of Oz, had witnessed the transformation
of the Goose and now decided he would keep
watch of the conspirators and see what they would
do next.</p>
<p>A Fox can move through a forest very softly, without
making any noise, and so the Wizard’s enemies
did not suspect his presence. But when they sat down
by the edge of the clearing, to talk, with their backs
toward him, the Wizard did not know whether to risk
being seen, by creeping closer to hear what they said,
or whether it would be better for him to hide himself
until they moved on again.</p>
<p>While he considered this question he discovered near
him a great tree which had a hollow trunk, and there
was a round hole in this tree, about three feet above
the ground. The Wizard Fox decided it would be
safer for him to hide inside the hollow tree, so he
sprang into the hole and crouched down in the hollow,
so that his eyes just came to the edge of the hole by
which he had entered, and from here he watched the
forms of the two Li-Mon-Eags.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>“This is my plan,” said the Nome to Kiki, speaking
so low that the Wizard could only hear the rumble of
his voice. “Since you can transform anything into
any form you wish, we will transform these monkeys
into an army, and with that army we will conquer the
Oz people.”</p>
<p>“The monkeys won’t make much of an army,”
objected Kiki.</p>
<p>“We need a great army, but not a numerous one,”
responded the Nome. “You will transform each
monkey into a giant man, dressed in a fine uniform
and armed with a sharp sword. There are fifty
monkeys over there and fifty giants would make as
big an army as we need.”</p>
<p>“What will they do with the swords?” asked Kiki.
“Nothing can kill the Oz people.”</p>
<p>“True,” said Ruggedo. “The Oz people cannot be
killed, but they can be cut into small pieces, and while
every piece will still be alive, we can scatter the pieces
around so that they will be quite helpless. Therefore,
the Oz people will be afraid of the swords of our army,
and we will conquer them with ease.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>“That seems like a good idea,” replied the boy,
approvingly. “And in such a case, we need not bother
with the other beasts of the forest.”</p>
<p>“No; you have frightened the beasts, and they would
no longer consent to assist us in conquering Oz. But
those monkeys are foolish creatures, and once they are
transformed to Giants, they will do just as we say and
obey our commands. Can you transform them all at
once?”</p>
<p>“No, I must take one at a time,” said Kiki. “But
the fifty transformations can be made in an hour or so.
Stay here, Ruggedo, and I will change the first monkey—that
one at the left, on the end of the limb—into a
Giant with a sword.”</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” asked the Nome.</p>
<p>“I must not speak the Magic Word in the presence
of another person,” declared Kiki, who was determined
not to allow his treacherous companion to learn his
secret, “so I will go where you cannot hear me.”</p>
<p>Ruggedo the Nome was disappointed, but he hoped
still to catch the boy unawares and surprise the Magic
Word. So he merely nodded his lion head, and Kiki
got up and went back into the forest a short distance.
Here he spied a hollow tree, and by chance it was the
same hollow tree in which the Wizard of Oz, now in
the form of a Fox, had hidden himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>As Kiki ran up to the tree the Fox ducked its head,
so that it was out of sight in the dark hollow beneath
the hole, and then Kiki put his face into the hole and
whispered: “I want that monkey on the branch at
the left to become a Giant man fifty feet tall, dressed
in a uniform and with a sharp sword—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!”</p>
<p>Then he ran back to Ruggedo, but the Wizard Fox
had heard quite plainly every word that he had said.</p>
<p>The monkey was instantly transformed into the
Giant, and the Giant was so big that as he stood on the
ground his head was higher than the trees of the forest.
The monkeys raised a great chatter but did not seem
to understand that the Giant was one of themselves.</p>
<p>“Good!” cried the Nome. “Hurry, Kiki, and transform
the others.”</p>
<p>So Kiki rushed back to the tree and putting his face
to the hollow, whispered:</p>
<p>“I want the next monkey to be just like the first—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!”</p>
<p>Again the Wizard Fox heard the Magic Word, and
just how it was pronounced. But he sat still in the
hollow and waited to hear it again, so it would be
impressed on his mind and he would not forget it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Kiki kept running to the edge of the forest and back
to the hollow tree again until he had whispered the
Magic Word six times and six monkeys had been
changed to six great giants. Then the Wizard
decided he would make an experiment and use the
Magic Word himself. So, while Kiki was running
back to the Nome, the Fox stuck his head out of the
hollow and said softly: “I want that creature who is
running to become a hickory-nut—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="345" src="images/i165.jpg" width="480" id="img_images_i165.jpg">
</div>
<p>Instantly the Li-Mon-Eag form of Kiki Aru the
Hyup disappeared and a small hickory-nut rolled upon
the ground a moment and then lay still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>The Wizard was delighted, and leaped from the hollow
just as Ruggedo looked around to see what had
become of Kiki. The Nome saw the Fox but no Kiki,
so he hastily rose to his feet. The Wizard did not
know how powerful the queer beast might be, so he
resolved to take no chances.</p>
<p>“I want this creature to become a walnut—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!”
he said aloud. But he did not pronounce
the Magic Word in quite the right way, and
Ruggedo’s form did not change. But the Nome knew
at once that “<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl!</span>” was the Magic Word, so
he rushed at the Fox and cried:</p>
<p>“I want you to become a Goose—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!”</p>
<p>But the Nome did not pronounce the word aright,
either, having never heard it spoken but once before,
and then with a wrong accent. So the Fox was not
transformed, but it had to run away to escape being
caught by the angry Nome.</p>
<p>Ruggedo now began pronouncing the Magic Word
in every way he could think of, hoping to hit the right
one, and the Fox, hiding in a bush, was somewhat
troubled by the fear that he might succeed. However,
the Wizard, who was used to magic arts, remained
calm and soon remembered exactly how Kiki Aru had
pronounced the word. So he repeated the sentence
he had before uttered and Ruggedo the Nome became
an ordinary walnut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>The Wizard now crept out from the bush and said:
“I want my own form again—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="295" src="images/i167.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i167.jpg">
</div>
<p>Instantly he was the Wizard of Oz, and after picking
up the hickory-nut and the walnut, and carefully placing
them in his pocket, he ran back to the big clearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Dorothy the Lamb uttered a bleat of delight when
she saw her old friend restored to his natural shape.
The others were all there, not having found the Goose.
The fat Gillikin woman, the Munchkin boy, the Rabbit
and the Glass Cat crowded around the Wizard and
asked what had happened.</p>
<p>Before he explained anything of his adventure, he
transformed them all—except, of course, the Glass
Cat—into their natural shapes, and when their joy
permitted them to quiet somewhat, he told how he had
by chance surprised the Magician’s secret and been
able to change the two Li-Mon-Eags into shapes that
could not speak, and therefore would be unable to help
themselves. And the little Wizard showed his astonished
friends the hickory-nut and the walnut to prove
that he had spoken the truth.</p>
<p>“But—see here!”—exclaimed Dorothy, “What
has become of those Giant Soldiers who used to be
monkeys?”</p>
<p>“I forgot all about them!” admitted the Wizard;
“but I suppose they are still standing there in the
forest.”</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER 15</p>
<p>Trot and Cap’n Bill stood
before the Magic Flower, actually
rooted to the spot.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you hungry,
Cap’n?” asked the little girl,
with a long sigh, for she had
been standing there for hours
and hours.</p>
<p>“Well,” replied the sailor-man,
“I ain’t sayin’ as I
couldn’t <i>eat</i>, Trot—if a dinner
was handy—but I guess
old folks don’t get as hungry as young folks do.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>“I’m not sure ’bout that, Cap’n Bill,” she said
thoughtfully. “Age <i>might</i> make a difference, but
seems to me <i>size</i> would make a bigger difference. Seeing
you’re twice as big as me, you ought to be twice
as hungry.”</p>
<p>“I hope I am,” he rejoined, “for I can stand it a
while longer. I do hope the Glass Cat will hurry, and
I hope the Wizard won’t waste time a-comin’ to us.”</p>
<p>Trot sighed again and watched the wonderful Magic
Flower, because there was nothing else to do. Just
now a lovely group of pink peonies budded and
bloomed, but soon they faded away, and a mass of deep
blue lilies took their place. Then some yellow chrysanthemums
blossomed on the plant, and when they
had opened all their petals and reached perfection,
they gave way to a lot of white floral balls spotted
with crimson—a flower Trot had never seen before.</p>
<p>“But I get awful tired watchin’ flowers an’ flowers
an’ flowers,” she said impatiently.</p>
<p>“They’re mighty pretty,” observed Cap’n Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>“I know; and if a person could come and look at the
Magic Flower just when she felt like it, it would be a
fine thing, but to <i>have to</i> stand and watch it, whether
you want to or not, isn’t so much fun. I wish, Cap’n
Bill, the thing would grow fruit for a while instead of
flowers.”</p>
<p>Scarcely had she spoken when the white balls with
crimson spots faded away and a lot of beautiful ripe
peaches took their place. With a cry of mingled
surprise and delight Trot reached out and plucked a
peach from the bush and began to eat it, finding it
delicious. Cap’n Bill was somewhat dazed at the
girl’s wish being granted so quickly, so before he
could pick a peach they had faded away and bananas
took their place. “Grab one, Cap’n!” exclaimed Trot,
and even while eating the peach she seized a banana
with her other hand and tore it from the bush.</p>
<p>The old sailor was still bewildered. He put out a
hand indeed, but he was too late, for now the bananas
disappeared and lemons took their place.</p>
<p>“Pshaw!” cried Trot. “You can’t eat those things;
but watch out, Cap’n, for something else.”</p>
<p>Cocoanuts next appeared, but Cap’n Bill shook his
head.</p>
<p>“Ca’n’t crack ’em,” he remarked, “’cause we haven’t
anything handy to smash ’em with.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>“Well, take one, anyhow,” advised Trot; but the
cocoanuts were gone now, and a deep, purple, pear-shaped
fruit which was unknown to them took their
place. Again Cap’n Bill hesitated, and Trot said to
him:</p>
<p>“You ought to have captured a peach and a banana,
as I did. If you’re not careful, Cap’n, you’ll miss all
your chances. Here, I’ll divide my banana with you.”</p>
<p>Even as she spoke, the Magic Plant was covered
with big red apples, growing on every branch, and
Cap’n Bill hesitated no longer. He grabbed with both
hands and picked two apples, while Trot had only time
to secure one before they were gone.</p>
<p>“It’s curious,” remarked the sailor, munching his
apple, “how these fruits keep good when you’ve
picked ’em, but dis’pear inter thin air if they’re left
on the bush.”</p>
<p>“The whole thing is curious,” declared the girl,
“and it couldn’t exist in any country but this, where
magic is so common. Those are limes. Don’t pick ’em,
for they’d pucker up your mouth and—Ooo! here
come plums!” and she tucked her apple in her apron
pocket and captured three plums—each one almost as
big as an egg—before they disappeared. Cap’n Bill
got some too, but both were too hungry to fast any
longer, so they began eating their apples and plums
and let the magic bush bear all sorts of fruits, one after
another. The Cap’n stopped once to pick a fine cantaloupe,
which he held under his arm, and Trot, having
finished her plums, got a handful of cherries and an
orange; but when almost every sort of fruit had
appeared on the bush, the crop ceased and only flowers,
as before, bloomed upon it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="692" src="images/i173.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i173.jpg">
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>“I wonder why it changed back,” mused Trot, who
was not worried because she had enough fruit to satisfy
her hunger.</p>
<p>“Well, you only wished it would bear fruit ‘for a
while,’” said the sailor, “and it did. P’raps if you’d
said ‘forever,’ Trot, it would have always been fruit.”</p>
<p>“But why should <i>my</i> wish be obeyed?” asked the
girl. “I’m not a fairy or a wizard or any kind of a
magic-maker.”</p>
<p>“I guess,” replied Cap’n Bill, “that this little island
is a magic island, and any folks on it can tell the bush
what to produce, an’ it’ll produce it.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I could wish for anything else, Cap’n,
and get it?” she inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>“What are you thinkin’ of, Trot?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of wishing that these roots on our
feet would disappear, and let us free.”</p>
<p>“Try it, Trot.”</p>
<p>So she tried it, and the wish had no effect whatever.
“Try it yourself, Cap’n,” she suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Then Cap’n Bill made the wish to be free, with no
better result.</p>
<p>“No,” said he, “it’s no use; the wishes only affect
the Magic Plant; but I’m glad we can make it bear
fruit, ’cause now we know we won’t starve before the
Wizard gets to us.”</p>
<p>“But I’m gett’n’ tired standing here so long,” complained
the girl. “If I could only lift one foot, and
rest it, I’d feel better.”</p>
<p>“Same with me, Trot. I’ve noticed that if you’ve
got to do a thing, and can’t help yourself, it gets to
be a hardship mighty quick.”</p>
<p>“Folks that can raise their feet don’t appreciate
what a blessing it is,” said Trot thoughtfully. “I
never knew before what fun it is to raise one foot,
an’ then another, any time you feel like it.”</p>
<p>“There’s lots o’ things folks don’t ’preciate,” replied
the sailor-man. “If somethin’ would ’most stop your
breath, you’d think breathin’ easy was the finest thing
in life. When a person’s well, he don’t realize how
jolly it is, but when he gets sick he ’members the time
he was well, an’ wishes that time would come back.
Most folks forget to thank God for givin’ ’em two
good legs, till they lose one o’ ’em, like I did; and
then it’s too late, ’cept to praise God for leavin’ one.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>“Your wooden leg ain’t so bad, Cap’n,” she
remarked, looking at it critically. “Anyhow, it don’t
take root on a Magic Island, like our meat legs do.”</p>
<p>“I ain’t complaining” said Cap’n Bill. “What’s
that swimmin’ towards us, Trot?” he added, looking
over the Magic Flower and across the water.</p>
<p>The girl looked, too, and then she replied.</p>
<p>“It’s a bird of some sort. It’s like a duck, only I
never saw a duck have so many colors.”</p>
<p>The bird swam swiftly and gracefully toward the
Magic Isle, and as it drew nearer its gorgeously colored
plumage astonished them. The feathers were
of many hues of glistening greens and blues and purples,
and it had a yellow head with a red plume, and
pink, white and violet in its tail. When it reached
the Isle, it came ashore and approached them, waddling
slowly and turning its head first to one side and
then to the other, so as to see the girl and the sailor
better.</p>
<p>“You’re strangers,” said the bird, coming to a halt
near them, “and you’ve been caught by the Magic
Isle and made prisoners.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” returned Trot, with a sigh; “we’re rooted.
But I hope we won’t grow.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>“You’ll grow small,” said the Bird. “You’ll keep
growing smaller every day, until bye and bye there’ll
be nothing left of you. That’s the usual way, on this
Magic Isle.”</p>
<p>“How do you know about it, and who are you, anyhow?”
asked Cap’n Bill.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="294" src="images/i177.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i177.jpg">
</div>
<p>“I’m the Lonesome Duck,” replied the bird. “I
suppose you’ve heard of me?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Trot, “I can’t say I have. What makes
you lonesome?”</p>
<p>“Why, I haven’t any family or any relations,”
returned the Duck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>“Haven’t you any friends?”</p>
<p>“Not a friend. And I’ve nothing to do. I’ve lived
a long time, and I’ve got to live forever, because I
belong in the Land of Oz, where no living thing dies.
Think of existing year after year, with no friends,
no family, and nothing to do! Can you wonder I’m
lonesome?”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you make a few friends, and find something
to do?” inquired Cap’n Bill.</p>
<p>“I can’t make friends because everyone I meet—bird,
beast or person—is disagreeable to me. In a
few minutes I shall be unable to bear your society
longer, and then I’ll go away and leave you,” said the
Lonesome Duck. “And, as for doing anything, there’s
no use in it. All I meet are doing something, so I
have decided it’s common and uninteresting and I
prefer to remain lonesome.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you have to hunt for your food?” asked
Trot.</p>
<p>“No. In my diamond palace, a little way up the
river, food is magically supplied me; but I seldom eat,
because it is so common.”</p>
<p>“You must be a Magician Duck,” remarked Cap’n
Bill.</p>
<p>“Why so?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>“Well, ordinary ducks don’t have diamond palaces
an’ magic food, like you do.”</p>
<p>“True; and that’s another reason why I’m lonesome.
You must remember I’m the only Duck in the Land
of Oz, and I’m not like any other duck in the outside
world.”</p>
<p>“Seems to me you <i>like</i> bein’ lonesome,” observed
Cap’n Bill.</p>
<p>“I can’t say I like it, exactly,” replied the Duck,
“but since it seems to be my fate, I’m rather proud
of it.”</p>
<p>“How do you s’pose a single, solitary Duck happened
to be in the Land of Oz?” asked Trot, wonderingly.</p>
<p>“I used to know the reason, many years ago, but
I’ve quite forgotten it,” declared the Duck. “The
reason for a thing is never so important as the thing
itself, so there’s no use remembering anything but
the fact that I’m lonesome.”</p>
<p>“I guess you’d be happier if you tried to do something,”
asserted Trot. “If you can’t do anything for
yourself, you can do things for others, and then you’d
get lots of friends and stop being lonesome.”</p>
<p>“Now you’re getting disagreeable,” said the Lonesome
Duck, “and I shall have to go and leave you.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>“Can’t you help us any,” pleaded the girl. “If
there’s anything magic about you, you might get us
out of this scrape.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t any magic strong enough to get you
off the Magic Isle,” replied the Lonesome Duck.
“What magic I possess is very simple, but I find it
enough for my own needs.”</p>
<p>“If we could only sit down a while, we could stand
it better,” said Trot, “but we have nothing to sit on.”</p>
<p>“Then you will have to stand it,” said the Lonesome
Duck.</p>
<p>“P’raps you’ve enough magic to give us a couple
of stools,” suggested Cap’n Bill.</p>
<p>“A duck isn’t supposed to know what stools are,”
was the reply.</p>
<p>“But you’re different from all other ducks.”</p>
<p>“That is true.” The strange creature seemed to
reflect for a moment, looking at them sharply from
its round black eyes. Then it said: “Sometimes,
when the sun is hot, I grow a toadstool to shelter me
from its rays. Perhaps you could sit on toadstools.”</p>
<p>“Well, if they were strong enough, they’d do,”
answered Cap’n Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>“Then, before I go I’ll give you a couple,” said the
Lonesome Duck, and began waddling about in a small
circle. It went around the circle to the right three
times, and then it went around to the left three times.
Then it hopped backward three times and forward
three times.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” asked Trot.</p>
<p>“Don’t interrupt. This is an incantation,” replied
the Lonesome Duck, but now it began making a succession
of soft noises that sounded like quacks and
seemed to mean nothing at all. And it kept up these
sounds so long that Trot finally exclaimed:</p>
<p>“Can’t you hurry up and finish that ’cantation?
If it takes all summer to make a couple of toadstools,
you’re not much of a magician.”</p>
<p>“I told you not to interrupt,” said the Lonesome
Duck, sternly. “If you get <i>too</i> disagreeable, you’ll
drive me away before I finish this incantation.”</p>
<p>Trot kept quiet, after the rebuke, and the Duck
resumed the quacky muttering. Cap’n Bill chuckled
a little to himself and remarked to Trot in a whisper:
“For a bird that ain’t got anything to do, this Lonesome
Duck is makin’ consider’ble fuss. An’ I ain’t
sure, after all, as toadstools would be worth sittin’ on.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Even as he spoke, the sailor-man felt something
touch him from behind and, turning his head, he found
a big toadstool in just the right place and of just the
right size to sit upon. There was one behind Trot,
too, and with a cry of pleasure the little girl sank
back upon it and found it a very comfortable seat—solid,
yet almost like a cushion. Even Cap’n Bill’s
weight did not break his toadstool down, and when
both were seated, they found that the Lonesome Duck
had waddled away and was now at the water’s edge.</p>
<p>“Thank you, ever so much!” cried Trot, and the
sailor called out: “Much obliged!”</p>
<p>But the Lonesome Duck paid no attention. Without
even looking in their direction again, the gaudy
fowl entered the water and swam gracefully away.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER 16</p>
<p>When the six monkeys were
transformed by Kiki Aru into
six giant soldiers fifty feet
tall, their heads came above
the top of the trees, which in
this part of the forest were
not so high as in some other
parts; and, although the trees
were somewhat scattered, the
bodies of the giant soldiers
were so big that they quite
filled the spaces in which they
stood and the branches pressed them on every side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Of course, Kiki was foolish to have made his soldiers
so big, for now they could not get out of the
forest. Indeed, they could not stir a step, but were
imprisoned by the trees. Even had they been in the
little clearing they could not have made their way
out of it, but they were a little beyond the clearing.
At first, the other monkeys who had not been
enchanted were afraid of the soldiers, and hastily
quitted the place; but soon finding that the great men
stood stock still, although grunting indignantly at
their transformation, the band of monkeys returned
to the spot and looked at them curiously, not guessing
that they were really monkeys and their own
friends.</p>
<p>The soldiers couldn’t see them, their heads being
above the trees; they could not even raise their arms
or draw their sharp swords, so closely were they held
by the leafy branches. So the monkeys, finding the
giants helpless, began climbing up their bodies, and
presently all the band were perched on the shoulders
of the giants and peering into their faces.</p>
<p>“I’m Ebu, your father,” cried one soldier to a monkey
who had perched upon his left ear, “but some
cruel person has enchanted me.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>“I’m your Uncle Peeker,” said another soldier to
another monkey.</p>
<p>So, very soon all the monkeys knew the truth and
were sorry for their friends and relations and angry
at the person—whoever it was—who had transformed
them. There was a great chattering among
the tree-tops, and the noise attracted other monkeys,
so that the clearing and all the trees around were
full of them.</p>
<p>Rango the Gray Ape, who was the Chief of all the
monkey tribes of the forest, heard the uproar and came
to see what was wrong with his people. And Rango,
being wiser and more experienced, at once knew that
the strange magician who looked like a mixed-up
beast was responsible for the transformations. He
realized that the six giant soldiers were helpless prisoners,
because of their size, and knew he was powerless
to release them. So, although he feared to meet
the terrible magician, he hurried away to the great
clearing to tell Gugu the King what had happened
and to try to find the Wizard of Oz and get him to
save his six enchanted subjects.</p>
<p>Rango darted into the Great Clearing just as the
Wizard had restored all the enchanted ones around
him to their proper shapes, and the Gray Ape was
glad to hear that the wicked magician-beast had been
conquered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>

<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>“But now, O mighty Wizard, you must come with
me to where six of my people are transformed into
six great giant men,” he said, “for if they are allowed
to remain there, their happiness and their future lives
will be ruined.”</p>
<p>The Wizard did not reply at once, for he was thinking
this a good opportunity to win Rango’s consent
to his taking some monkeys to the Emerald City for
Ozma’s birthday cake.</p>
<p>“It is a great thing you ask of me, O Rango the
Gray Ape,” said he, “for the bigger the giants are
the more powerful their enchantment, and the more
difficult it will be to restore them to their natural
forms. However, I will think it over.”</p>
<p>Then the Wizard went to another part of the clearing
and sat on a log and appeared to be in deep
thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The Glass Cat had been greatly interested in the
Gray Ape’s story and was curious to see what the
giant soldiers looked like. Hearing that their heads
extended above the tree-tops, the Glass Cat decided
that if it climbed the tall avocado tree that stood at
the side of the clearing, it might be able to see the
giants’ heads. So, without mentioning her errand,
the crystal creature went to the tree and, by sticking
her sharp glass claws in the bark, easily climbed the
tree to its very top and, looking over the forest, saw
the six giant heads, although they were now a long
way off. It was, indeed, a remarkable sight, for the
huge heads had immense soldier caps on them, with
red and yellow plumes and looked very fierce and
terrible, although the monkey hearts of the giants
were at that moment filled with fear.</p>
<p>Having satisfied her curiosity, the Glass Cat began
to climb down from the tree more slowly. Suddenly
she discerned the Wizard’s black bag hanging to a
limb of the tree. She grasped the black bag in her
glass teeth, and although it was rather heavy for so
small an animal, managed to get it free and to carry
it safely down to the ground. Then she looked around
for the Wizard and seeing him seated upon the stump
she hid the black bag among some leaves and then
went over to where the Wizard sat.</p>
<p>“I forgot to tell you,” said the Glass Cat, “that Trot
and Cap’n Bill are in trouble, and I came here to hunt
you up and get you to go and rescue them.”</p>
<p>“Good gracious, Cat! Why didn’t you tell me
before?” exclaimed the Wizard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>“For the reason that I found so much excitement
here that I forgot Trot and Cap’n Bill.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with them?” asked the Wizard.</p>
<p>Then the Glass Cat explained how they had gone
to get the Magic Flower for Ozma’s birthday gift and
had been trapped by the magic of the queer island.
The Wizard was really alarmed, but he shook his
head and said sadly:</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I can’t help my dear friends, because
I’ve lost my black bag.”</p>
<p>“If I find it, will you go to them?” asked the
creature.</p>
<p>“Of course,” replied the Wizard. “But I do not
think that a Glass Cat with nothing but pink brains
can succeed when all the rest of us have failed.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you admire my pink brains?” demanded
the Cat.</p>
<p>“They’re pretty,” admitted the Wizard, “but
they’re not regular brains, you know, and so we don’t
expect them to amount to much.”</p>
<p>“But if I find your black bag—and find it inside
of five minutes—will you admit my pink brains are
better than your common human brains?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>“Well, I’ll admit they’re better <i>hunters</i>,” said the
Wizard, reluctantly, “but you can’t do it. We’ve
searched everywhere, and the black bag isn’t to be
found.”</p>
<p>“That shows how much you know!” retorted the
Glass Cat, scornfully. “Watch my brains a minute,
and see them whirl around.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="345" src="images/i191.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i191.jpg">
</div>
<p>The Wizard watched, for he was anxious to regain
his black bag, and the pink brains really did whirl
around in a remarkable manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>“Now, come with me,” commanded the Glass Cat,
and led the Wizard straight to the spot where it had
covered the bag with leaves. “According to my
brains,” said the creature, “your black bag ought to
be here.”</p>
<p>Then it scratched at the leaves and uncovered the
bag, which the Wizard promptly seized with a cry of
delight. Now that he had regained his Magic Tools,
he felt confident he could rescue Trot and Cap’n Bill.</p>
<p>Rango the Gray Ape was getting impatient. He
now approached the Wizard and said:</p>
<p>“Well, what do you intend to do about those poor
enchanted monkeys?”</p>
<p>“I’ll make a bargain with you, Rango,” replied
the little man. “If you will let me take a dozen of
your monkeys to the Emerald City, and keep them
until after Ozma’s birthday, I’ll break the enchantment
of the six Giant Soldiers and return them to
their natural forms.”</p>
<p>But the Gray Ape shook his head.</p>
<p>“I can’t do it,” he declared. “The monkeys would
be very lonesome and unhappy in the Emerald City
and your people would tease them and throw stones
at them, which would cause them to fight and bite.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>“The people won’t see them till Ozma’s birthday
dinner,” promised the Wizard. “I’ll make them very
small—about four inches high, and I’ll keep them
in a pretty cage in my own room, where they will be
safe from harm. I’ll feed them the nicest kind of
food, train them to do some clever tricks, and on
Ozma’s birthday I’ll hide the twelve little monkeys
inside a cake. When Ozma cuts the cake the monkeys
will jump out on to the table and do their tricks.
The next day I will bring them back to the forest
and make them big as ever, and they’ll have some
exciting stories to tell their friends. What do you
say, Rango?”</p>
<p>“I say no!” answered the Gray Ape. “I won’t
have my monkeys enchanted and made to do tricks
for the Oz people.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” said the Wizard calmly; “then I’ll go.
Come, Dorothy,” he called to the little girl, “let’s start
on our journey.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to save those six monkeys who
are giant soldiers?” asked Rango, anxiously.</p>
<p>“Why should I?” returned the Wizard. “If you
will not do me the favor I ask, you cannot expect
me to favor you.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” said the Gray Ape. “I’ve
changed my mind. If you will treat the twelve monkeys
nicely and bring them safely back to the forest.
I’ll let you take them.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>“Thank you,” replied the Wizard, cheerfully.
“We’ll go at once and save those giant soldiers.”</p>
<p>So all the party left the clearing and proceeded to
the place where the giants still stood among the trees.
Hundreds of monkeys, apes, baboons and orang-outangs
had gathered round, and their wild chatter
could be heard a mile away. But the Gray Ape soon
hushed the babel of sounds, and the Wizard lost no
time in breaking the enchantments. First one and
then another giant soldier disappeared and became
an ordinary monkey again, and the six were shortly
returned to their friends in their proper forms.</p>
<p>This action made the Wizard very popular with
the great army of monkeys, and when the Gray Ape
announced that the Wizard wanted to borrow twelve
monkeys to take to the Emerald City for a couple of
weeks, and asked for volunteers, nearly a hundred
offered to go, so great was their confidence in the little
man who had saved their comrades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>The Wizard selected a dozen that seemed intelligent
and good-tempered, and then he opened his black
bag and took out a queerly shaped dish that was silver
on the outside and gold on the inside. Into this dish
he poured a powder and set fire to it. It made a
thick smoke that quite enveloped the twelve monkeys,
as well as the form of the Wizard, but when
the smoke cleared away the dish had been changed
to a golden cage with silver bars, and the twelve
monkeys had become about three inches high and
were all seated comfortably inside the cage.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="398" src="images/i195.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i195.jpg">
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>The thousands of hairy animals who had witnessed
this act of magic were much astonished and applauded
the Wizard by barking aloud and shaking the limbs
of the trees in which they sat. Dorothy said: “That
was a fine trick, Wizard!” and the Gray Ape
remarked: “You are certainly the most wonderful
magician in all the Land of Oz!”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” modestly replied the little man. “Glinda’s
magic is better than mine, but mine seems good
enough to use on ordinary occasions. And now, Rango,
we will say good-bye, and I promise to return your
monkeys as happy and safe as they are now.”</p>
<p>The Wizard rode on the back of the Hungry Tiger
and carried the cage of monkeys very carefully, so
as not to joggle them. Dorothy rode on the back of
the Cowardly Lion, and the Glass Cat trotted, as
before, to show them the way.</p>
<p>Gugu the King crouched upon a log and watched
them go, but as he bade them farewell, the enormous
leopard said:</p>
<p>“I know now that you are the friends of beasts
and that the forest people may trust you. Whenever
the Wizard of Oz and Princess Dorothy enter the
Forest of Gugu hereafter, they will be as welcome
and as safe with us as ever they are in the Emerald
City.”</p>

</div>
<p class="center">CHAPTER 17</p>
<p>“You see,” explained the
Glass Cat, “that Magic Isle
where Trot and Cap’n Bill
are stuck is also in this Gillikin
country—over at the
east side of it, and it’s no
farther to go across-lots from
here than it is from here to
the Emerald City. So we’ll
save time by cutting across
the mountains.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you know
the way?” asked Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>“I know all the Land of Oz better than any other
living creature knows it,” asserted the Glass Cat.</p>
<p>“Go ahead, then, and guide us,” said the Wizard.
“We’ve left our poor friends helpless too long already,
and the sooner we rescue them the happier they’ll be.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you can get ’em out of their fix?”
the little girl inquired.</p>
<p>“I’ve no doubt of it,” the Wizard assured her. “But
I can’t tell what sort of magic I must use until I get
to the place and discover just how they are enchanted.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of that Magic Isle where the Wonderful
Flower grows,” remarked the Cowardly Lion.
“Long ago, when I used to live in the forests, the
beasts told stories about the Isle and how the Magic
Flower was placed there to entrap strangers—men
or beasts.”</p>
<p>“Is the Flower really wonderful?” questioned
Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>“I have heard it is the most beautiful plant in the
world,” answered the Lion. “I have never seen it
myself, but friendly beasts have told me that they
have stood on the shore of the river and looked across
at the plant in the gold flowerpot and seen hundreds
of flowers, of all sorts and sizes, blossom upon it in
quick succession. It is said that if one picks the
flowers while they are in bloom they will remain
perfect for a long time, but if they are not picked
they soon disappear and are replaced by other flowers.
That, in my opinion, makes the magic plant the most
wonderful in existence.”</p>
<p>“But these are only stories,” said the girl. “Has
any of your friends ever picked a flower from the
wonderful plant?”</p>
<p>“No,” admitted the Cowardly Lion, “for if any
living thing ventures upon the Magic Isle, where
the golden flowerpot stands, that man or beast takes
root in the soil and cannot get away again.”</p>
<p>“What happens to them, then?” asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>“They grow smaller, hour by hour and day by day,
and finally disappear entirely.”</p>
<p>“Then,” said the girl anxiously, “we must hurry
up, or Cap’n Bill an’ Trot will get too small to be
comf’table.”</p>
<p>They were proceeding at a rapid pace during this
conversation, for the Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly
Lion were obliged to move swiftly in order to
keep pace with the Glass Cat. After leaving the
Forest of Gugu they crossed a mountain range, and
then a broad plain, after which they reached another
forest, much smaller than that where Gugu ruled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>“The Magic Isle is in this forest,” said the Glass
Cat, “but the river is at the other side of the forest.
There is no path through the trees, but if we keep
going east, we will find the river, and then it will be
easy to find the Magic Isle.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever traveled this way before?” inquired
the Wizard.</p>
<p>“Not exactly,” admitted the Cat, “but I know we
shall reach the river if we go east through the forest.”</p>
<p>“Lead on, then,” said the Wizard.</p>
<p>The Glass Cat started away, and at first it was
easy to pass between the trees; but before long the
underbrush and vines became thick and tangled, and
after pushing their way through these obstacles for
a time, our travelers came to a place where even the
Glass Cat could not push through.</p>
<p>“We’d better go back and find a path,” suggested
the Hungry Tiger.</p>
<p>“I’m s’prised at you,” said Dorothy, eyeing the
Glass Cat severely.</p>
<p>“I’m surprised, myself,” replied the Cat. “But
it’s a long way around the forest to where the river
enters it, and I thought we could save time by going
straight through.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>“No one can blame you,” said the Wizard, “and I
think, instead of turning back, I can make a path
that will allow us to proceed.”</p>
<p>He opened his black bag and after searching among
his magic tools drew out a small axe, made of some
metal so highly polished that it glittered brightly
even in the dark forest. The Wizard laid the little
axe on the ground and said in a commanding voice:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“Chop, Little Axe, chop clean and true;</p>
<p class="t0">A path for our feet you must quickly hew.</p>
<p class="t0">Chop till this tangle of jungle is passed;</p>
<p class="t0">Chop to the east, Little Axe—chop fast!”</p>
</div>
<p>Then the little axe began to move and flashed its
bright blade right and left, clearing a way through
vine and brush and scattering the tangled barrier so
quickly that the Lion and the Tiger, carrying Dorothy
and the Wizard and the cage of monkeys on their
backs, were able to stride through the forest at a fast
walk. The brush seemed to melt away before them
and the little axe chopped so fast that their eyes only
saw a twinkling of the blade. Then, suddenly, the
forest was open again, and the little axe, having
obeyed its orders, lay still upon the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>The Wizard picked up the magic axe and after
carefully wiping it with his silk handkerchief put it
away in his black bag. Then they went on and in
a short time reached the river.</p>
<p>“Let me see,” said the Glass Cat, looking up and
down the stream, “I think we are below the Magic
Isle; so we must go up the stream until we come to it.”</p>
<p>So up the stream they traveled, walking comfortably
on the river bank, and after a while the water
broadened and a sharp bend appeared in the river,
hiding all below from their view. They walked
briskly along, however, and had nearly reached the
bend when a voice cried warningly: “Look out!”</p>
<p>The travelers halted abruptly and the Wizard said:
“Look out for what?”</p>
<p>“You almost stepped on my Diamond Palace,”
replied the voice, and a duck with gorgeously colored
feathers appeared before them. “Beasts and men
are terribly clumsy,” continued the Duck in an irritated
tone, “and you’ve no business on this side of
the river, anyway. What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“We’ve come to rescue some friends of ours who
are stuck fast on the Magic Isle in this river,”
explained Dorothy.</p>
<p>“I know ’em,” said the Duck. “I’ve been to see
’em, and they’re stuck fast, all right. You may as
well go back home, for no power can save them.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>“This is the Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” said Dorothy,
pointing to the little man.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m the Lonesome Duck,” was the reply,
as the fowl strutted up and down to show its feathers
to best advantage. “I’m the great Forest Magician,
as any beast can tell you, but even I have no power
to destroy the dreadful charm of the Magic Isle.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="329" src="images/i203.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i203.jpg">
</div>
<p>“Are you lonesome because you’re a magician?”
inquired Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>“No; I’m lonesome because I have no family and
no friends. But I like to be lonesome, so please don’t
offer to be friendly with me. Go away, and try not
to step on my Diamond Palace.”</p>
<p>“Where is it?” asked the girl.</p>
<p>“Behind this bush.”</p>
<p>Dorothy hopped off the lion’s back and ran around
the bush to see the Diamond Palace of the Lonesome
Duck, although the gaudy fowl protested in a series
of low quacks. The girl found, indeed, a glistening
dome formed of clearest diamonds, neatly cemented
together, with a doorway at the side just big enough
to admit the duck.</p>
<p>“Where did you find so many diamonds?” asked
Dorothy, wonderingly.</p>
<p>“I know a place in the mountains where they are
thick as pebbles,” said the Lonesome Duck, “and I
brought them here in my bill, one by one and put them
in the river and let the water run over them until
they were brightly polished. Then I built this palace,
and I’m positive it’s the only Diamond Palace in all
the world.”</p>
<p>“It’s the only one I know of,” said the little girl;
“but if you live in it all alone, I don’t see why it’s
any better than a wooden palace, or one of bricks
or cobble-stones.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>“You’re not supposed to understand that,” retorted
the Lonesome Duck. “But I might tell you, as a
matter of education, that a home of any sort should
be beautiful to those who live in it, and should not
be intended to please strangers. The Diamond Palace
is my home, and I like it. So I don’t care a quack
whether <i>you</i> like it or not.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="338" src="images/i205.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i205.jpg">
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>“Oh, but I do!” exclaimed Dorothy. “It’s lovely
on the outside, but—” Then she stopped speaking,
for the Lonesome Duck had entered his palace through
the little door without even saying good-bye. So
Dorothy returned to her friends and they resumed
their journey.</p>
<p>“Do you think, Wizard, the Duck was right in saying
no magic can rescue Trot and Cap’n Bill?” asked
the girl in a worried tone of voice.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think the Lonesome Duck was right
in saying that,” answered the Wizard, gravely, “but
it is possible that their enchantment will be harder
to overcome than I expected. I’ll do my best, of
course, and no one can do more than his best.”</p>
<p>That didn’t entirely relieve Dorothy’s anxiety, but
she said nothing more, and soon, on turning the bend
in the river, they came in sight of the Magic Isle.</p>
<p>“There they are!” exclaimed Dorothy eagerly.</p>
<p>“Yes, I see them,” replied the Wizard, nodding.
“They are sitting on two big toadstools.”</p>
<p>“That’s queer,” remarked the Glass Cat. “There
were no toadstools there when I left them.”</p>
<p>“What a lovely flower!” cried Dorothy in rapture,
as her gaze fell on the Magic Plant.</p>
<p>“Never mind the Flower, just now,” advised the
Wizard. “The most important thing is to rescue our
friends.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>By this time they had arrived at a place just opposite
the Magic Isle, and now both Trot and Cap’n Bill
saw the arrival of their friends and called to them
for help.</p>
<p>“How are you?” shouted the Wizard, putting his
hands to his mouth so they could hear him better
across the water.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="346" src="images/i207.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i207.jpg">
</div>
<p>“We’re in hard luck,” shouted Cap’n Bill, in reply.
“We’re anchored here and can’t move till you find a
way to cut the hawser.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>“What does he mean by that?” asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>“We can’t move our feet a bit!” called Trot, speaking
as loud as she could.</p>
<p>“Why not?” inquired Dorothy.</p>
<p>“They’ve got roots on ’em,” explained Trot.</p>
<p>It was hard to talk from so great a distance, so the
Wizard said to the Glass Cat:</p>
<p>“Go to the island and tell our friends to be patient,
for we have come to save them. It may take a little
time to release them, for the Magic of the Isle is new
to me and I shall have to experiment. But tell them
I’ll hurry as fast as I can.”</p>
<p>So the Glass Cat walked across the river under the
water to tell Trot and Cap’n Bill not to worry, and
the Wizard at once opened his black bag and began
to make his preparations.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER 18</p>
<p>He first set up a small silver
tripod and placed a gold basin
at the top of it. Into this
basin he put two powders—a
pink one and a sky-blue one—and
poured over them a
yellow liquid from a crystal
vial. Then he mumbled some
magic words, and the powders
began to sizzle and burn and
send out a cloud of violet
smoke that floated across the
river and completely enveloped
both Trot and Cap’n Bill, as well as the toadstools
on which they sat, and even the Magic Plant
in the gold flowerpot. Then, after the smoke had
disappeared into air, the Wizard called out to the
prisoners:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>“Are you free?”</p>
<p>Both Trot and Cap’n Bill tried to move their feet
and failed.</p>
<p>“No!” they shouted in answer.</p>
<p>The Wizard rubbed his bald head thoughtfully and
then took some other magic tools from the bag.</p>
<p>First he placed a little black ball in a silver pistol
and shot it toward the Magic Isle. The ball exploded
just over the head of Trot and scattered a thousand
sparks over the little girl.</p>
<p>“Oh!” said the Wizard, “I guess that will set her
free.”</p>
<p>But Trot’s feet were still rooted in the ground of
the Magic Isle, and the disappointed Wizard had to
try something else.</p>
<p>For almost an hour he worked hard, using almost
every magic tool in his black bag, and still Cap’n Bill
and Trot were not rescued.</p>
<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Dorothy, “I’m ’fraid we’ll
have to go to Glinda, after all.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>That made the little Wizard blush, for it shamed
him to think that his magic was not equal to that of
the Magic Isle.</p>
<p>“I won’t give up yet, Dorothy,” he said, “for I know
a lot of wizardry that I haven’t yet tried. I don’t
know what magician enchanted this little island, or
what his powers were, but I do know that I can break
any enchantment known to the ordinary witches and
magicians that used to inhabit the Land of Oz. It’s
like unlocking a door; all you need is to find the right
key.”</p>
<p>“But ’spose you haven’t the right key with you,”
suggested Dorothy; “what then?”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll have to make the key,” he answered.</p>
<p>The Glass Cat now came back to their side of the
river, walking under the water, and said to the Wizard:
“They’re getting frightened over there on the
island because they’re both growing smaller every
minute. Just now, when I left them, both Trot
and Cap’n Bill were only about half their natural
sizes.”</p>
<p>“I think,” said the Wizard reflectively, “that I’d
better go to the shore of the island, where I can talk
to them and work to better advantage. How did Trot
and Cap’n Bill get to the island?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>“On a raft,” answered the Glass Cat. “It’s over
there now on the beach.”</p>
<p>“I suppose you’re not strong enough to bring the
raft to this side, are you?”</p>
<p>“No; I couldn’t move it an inch,” said the Cat.</p>
<p>“I’ll try to get it for you,” volunteered the Cowardly
Lion. “I’m dreadfully scared for fear the Magic
Isle will capture me, too; but I’ll try to get the raft
and bring it to this side for you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, my friend,” said the Wizard.</p>
<p>So the Lion plunged into the river and swam with
powerful strokes across to where the raft was beached
upon the island. Placing one paw on the raft, he
turned and struck out with his other three legs and so
strong was the great beast that he managed to drag
the raft from off the beach and propel it slowly to
where the Wizard stood on the river bank.</p>
<p>“Good!” exclaimed the little man, well pleased.</p>
<p>“May I go across with you?” asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>The Wizard hesitated.</p>
<p>“If you’ll take care not to leave the raft or step
foot on the island, you’ll be quite safe,” he decided.
So the Wizard told the Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly
Lion to guard the cage of monkeys until he
returned, and then he and Dorothy got upon the raft.
The paddle which Cap’n Bill had made was still there
so the little Wizard paddled the clumsy raft across
the water and ran it upon the beach of the Magic Isle
as close to the place where Cap’n Bill and Trot were
rooted as he could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<div class="img">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Dorothy was shocked to see how small the prisoners
had become, and Trot said to her friends: “If
you can’t save us soon, there’ll be nothing left of us.”</p>
<p>“Be patient, my dear,” counselled the Wizard, and
took the little axe from his black bag.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with that?” asked Cap’n
Bill.</p>
<p>“It’s a magic axe,” replied the Wizard, “and when
I tell it to chop, it will chop those roots from your feet
and you can run to the raft before they grow again.”</p>
<p>“Don’t!” shouted the sailor in alarm. “Don’t do
it! Those roots are all flesh roots, and our bodies are
feeding ’em while they’re growing into the ground.”</p>
<p>“To cut off the roots,” said Trot, “would be like
cutting off our fingers and toes.”</p>
<p>The Wizard put the little axe back in the black bag
and took out a pair of silver pincers.</p>
<p>“Grow—grow—grow!” he said to the pincers,
and at once they grew and extended until they reached
from the raft to the prisoners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>“What are you going to do now?” demanded Cap’n
Bill, fearfully eyeing the pincers.</p>
<p>“This magic tool will pull you up, roots and all, and
land you on this raft,” declared the Wizard.</p>
<p>“Don’t do it!” pleaded the sailor, with a shudder.
“It would hurt us awfully.”</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="338" src="images/i215.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i215.jpg">
</div>
<p>“It would be just like pulling teeth to pull us up
by the roots,” explained Trot.</p>
<p>“Grow small!” said the Wizard to the pincers, and
at once they became small and he threw them into
the black bag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>“I guess, friends, it’s all up with us, this time,”
remarked Cap’n Bill, with a dismal sigh.</p>
<p>“Please tell Ozma, Dorothy,” said Trot, “that we
got into trouble trying to get her a nice birthday
present. Then she’ll forgive us. The Magic Flower
is lovely and wonderful, but it’s just a lure to catch
folks on this dreadful island and then destroy them.
You’ll have a nice birthday party, without us, I’m
sure; and I hope, Dorothy, that none of you in the
Emerald City will forget me—or dear ol’ Cap’n Bill.”</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER 19</p>
<p>Dorothy was greatly distressed
and had hard work to
keep the tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>“Is that all you can do,
Wizard?” she asked the little
man.</p>
<p>“It’s all I can think of just
now,” he replied sadly. “But
I intend to keep on thinking
as long—as long—well, as
long as thinking will do any
good.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>They were all silent for a
time, Dorothy and the Wizard sitting thoughtfully
on the raft, and Trot and Cap’n Bill sitting thoughtfully
on the toadstools and growing gradually smaller
and smaller in size.</p>
<p>Suddenly Dorothy said: “Wizard, I’ve thought of
something!”</p>
<p>“What have you thought of?” he asked, looking
at the little girl with interest.</p>
<p>“Can you remember the Magic Word that transforms
people?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said he.</p>
<p>“Then you can transform Trot and Cap’n Bill into
birds or Bumblebees, and they can fly away to the
other shore. When they’re there, you can transform
’em into their reg’lar shapes again!”</p>
<p>“Can you do that, Wizard?” asked Cap’n Bill,
eagerly.</p>
<p>“I think so.”</p>
<p>“Roots an’ all?” inquired Trot.</p>
<p>“Why, the roots are now a part of you, and if you
were transformed to a bumble-bee the whole of you
would be transformed, of course, and you’d be free
of this awful island.”</p>
<p>“All right; do it!” cried the sailor-man.</p>
<p>So the Wizard said slowly and distinctly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>“I want Trot and Cap’n Bill to become bumble-bees—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!”</p>
<p>Fortunately, he pronounced the Magic Word in the
right way, and instantly Trot and Cap’n Bill vanished
from view, and up from the places where they had
been flew two bumble-bees.</p>
<p>“Hooray!” shouted Dorothy in delight; “they’re
saved!”</p>
<p>“I guess they are,” agreed the Wizard, equally
delighted.</p>
<p>The bees hovered over the raft an instant and then
flew across the river to where the Lion and the Tiger
waited. The Wizard picked up the paddle and paddled
the raft across as fast as he could. When it
reached the river bank, both Dorothy and the Wizard
leaped ashore and the little man asked excitedly:</p>
<p>“Where are the bees?”</p>
<p>“The bees?” inquired the Lion, who was half asleep
and did not know what had happened on the Magic
Isle.</p>
<p>“Yes; there were two of them.”</p>
<p>“Two bees?” said the Hungry Tiger, yawning.
“Why, I ate one of them and the Cowardly Lion ate
the other.”</p>
<p>“Goodness gracious!” cried Dorothy horrified.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>“It was little enough for our lunch,” remarked the
Tiger, “but the bees, were the only things we could
find.”</p>
<p>“How dreadful!” wailed Dorothy, wringing her
hands in despair. “You’ve eaten Trot and Cap’n
Bill.”</p>
<p>But just then she heard a buzzing overhead and
two bees alighted on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Here we are,” said a small voice in her ear. “I’m
Trot, Dorothy.”</p>
<p>“And I’m Cap’n Bill,” said the other bee.</p>
<p>Dorothy almost fainted, with relief, and the Wizard,
who was close by and had heard the tiny voices, gave
a laugh and said:</p>
<p>“You are not the only two bees in the forest, it
seems, but I advise you to keep away from the Lion
and the Tiger until you regain your proper forms.”</p>
<p>“Do it now, Wizard!” advised Dorothy. “They’re
so small that you never can tell what might happen
to ’em.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>So the Wizard gave the command and pronounced
the Magic Word, and in the instant Trot and Cap’n
Bill stood beside them as natural as before they had
met their fearful adventure. For they were no longer
small in size, because the Wizard had transformed
them from bumble-bees into the shapes and sizes that
nature had formerly given them. The ugly roots on
their feet had disappeared with the transformation.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="337" src="images/i221.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i221.jpg">
</div>
<p>While Dorothy was hugging Trot, and Trot was
softly crying because she was so happy, the Wizard
shook hands with Cap’n Bill and congratulated him
on his escape. The old sailor-man was so pleased that
he also shook the Lion’s paw and took off his hat and
bowed politely to the cage of monkeys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Then Cap’n Bill did a curious thing. He went to
a big tree and, taking out his knife, cut away a big,
broad piece of thick bark. Then he sat down on the
ground and after taking a roll of stout cord from his
pocket—which seemed to be full of all sorts of things—he
proceeded to bind the flat piece of bark to the
bottom of his good foot, over the leather sole.</p>
<p>“What’s that for?” inquired the Wizard.</p>
<p>“I hate to be stumped,” replied the sailor-man;
“so I’m goin’ back to that island.”</p>
<p>“And get enchanted again?” exclaimed Trot, with
evident disapproval.</p>
<p>“No; this time I’ll dodge the magic of the island.
I noticed that my wooden leg didn’t get stuck, or take
root, an’ neither did the glass feet of the Glass Cat.
It’s only a thing that’s made of meat—like man an’
beasts—that the magic can hold an’ root to the
ground. Our shoes are leather, an’ leather comes from
a beast’s hide. Our stockin’s are wool, an’ wool comes
from a sheep’s back. So, when we walked on the
Magic Isle, our feet took root there an’ held us fast.
But not my wooden leg. So now I’ll put a wooden
bottom on my other foot an’ the magic can’t stop me.”</p>
<p>“But why do you wish to go back to the island?”
asked Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>“Didn’t you see the Magic Flower in the gold
flower-pot?” returned Cap’n Bill.</p>
<p>“Of course I saw it, and it’s lovely and wonderful.”</p>
<p>“Well, Trot an’ I set out to get that magic plant
for a present to Ozma on her birthday, and I mean
to get it an’ take it back with us to the Emerald City.”</p>
<p>“That would be fine,” cried Trot eagerly, “if you
think you can do it, and it would be safe to try!”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure it is safe, the way I’ve fixed my
foot,” said the sailor, “an’ if I <i>should</i> happen to get
caught, I s’pose the Wizard could save me again.”</p>
<p>“I suppose I could,” agreed the Wizard. “Anyhow,
if you wish to try it, Cap’n Bill, go ahead and we’ll
stand by and watch what happens.”</p>
<p>So the sailor-man got upon the raft again and paddled
over to the Magic Isle, landing as close to the
golden flower-pot as he could. They watched him
walk across the land, put both arms around the flower-pot
and lift it easily from its place. Then he carried
it to the raft and set it down very gently. The removal
did not seem to affect the Magic Flower in any way,
for it was growing daffodils when Cap’n Bill picked it
up and on the way to the raft it grew tulips and gladioli.
During the time the sailor was paddling across
the river to where his friends awaited him, seven different
varieties of flowers bloomed in succession on
the plant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>“I guess the Magician who put it on the island never
thought that any one would carry it off,” said Dorothy.</p>
<p>“He figured that only men would want the plant,
and any man who went upon the island to get it would
be caught by the enchantment,” added the Wizard.</p>
<p>“After this,” remarked Trot, “no one will care to
go on the island, so it won’t be a trap any more.”</p>
<p>“There,” exclaimed Cap’n Bill, setting down the
Magic Plant in triumph upon the river bank, “if
Ozma gets a better birthday present than that, I’d
like to know what it can be!”</p>
<p>“It’ll s’prise her, all right,” declared Dorothy, standing
in awed wonder before the gorgeous blossoms and
watching them change from yellow roses to violets.</p>
<p>“It’ll s’prise ev’rybody in the Em’rald City,” Trot
asserted in glee, “and it’ll be Ozma’s present from
Cap’n Bill and me.”</p>
<p>“I think <i>I</i> ought to have a little credit,” objected
the Glass Cat. “I discovered the thing, and led you
to it, and brought the Wizard here to save you when
you got caught.”</p>
<p>“That’s true,” admitted Trot, “and I’ll tell Ozma
the whole story, so she’ll know how good you’ve been.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>

<p class="center">CHAPTER 20</p>
<p>“Now,” said the Wizard, “we
must start for home. But how
are we going to carry that big
gold flowerpot? Cap’n Bill
can’t lug it all the way, that’s
certain.”</p>
<p>“No,” acknowledged the
sailor-man; “it’s pretty heavy.
I could carry it for a little
while, but I’d have to stop to
rest every few minutes.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>“Couldn’t we put it on your
back?” Dorothy asked the
Cowardly Lion, with a good-natured yawn.</p>
<p>“I don’t object to carrying it, if you can fasten it
on,” answered the Lion.</p>
<p>“If it falls off,” said Trot, “it might get smashed
an’ be ruined.”</p>
<p>“I’ll fix it,” promised Cap’n Bill. “I’ll make a
flat board out of one of these tree trunks, an’ tie the
board on the lion’s back, an’ set the flowerpot on the
board.” He set to work at once to do this, but as he
only had his big knife for a tool his progress was slow.</p>
<p>So the Wizard took from his black bag a tiny saw
that shone like silver and said to it:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“Saw, little Saw, come show your power;</p>
<p class="t0">Make us a board for the Magic Flower.”</p>
</div>
<p>And at once the Little Saw began to move and it
sawed the log so fast that those who watched it work
were astonished. It seemed to understand, too, just
what the board was to be used for, for when it was
completed it was flat on top and hollowed beneath in
such a manner that it exactly fitted the Lion’s back.</p>
<p>“That beats whittlin’!” exclaimed Cap’n Bill,
admiringly. “You don’t happen to have <i>two</i> o’ them
saws; do you, Wizard?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>“No,” replied the Wizard, wiping the Magic Saw
carefully with his silk handkerchief and putting it
back in the black bag. “It’s the only saw of its kind
in the world; and if there were more like it, it wouldn’t
be so wonderful.”</p>
<p>They now tied the board on the Lion’s back, flat
side up, and Cap’n Bill carefully placed the Magic
Flower on the board.</p>
<p>“For fear o’ accidents,” he said, “I’ll walk beside
the lion and hold onto the flowerpot.”</p>
<p>Trot and Dorothy could both ride on the back of
the Hungry Tiger, and between them they carried
the cage of monkeys. But this arrangement left the
Wizard, as well as the sailor, to make the journey on
foot, and so the procession moved slowly and the
Glass Cat grumbled because it would take so long to
get to the Emerald City.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>The Cat was sour-tempered and grumpy, at first,
but before they had journeyed far, the crystal creature
had discovered a fine amusement. The long tails of
the monkeys were constantly sticking through the bars
of their cage, and when they did, the Glass Cat would
slyly seize the tails in her paws and pull them. That
made the monkeys scream, and their screams pleased
the Glass Cat immensely. Trot and Dorothy tried to
stop this naughty amusement, but when they were
not looking the Cat would pull the tails again, and
the creature was so sly and quick that the monkeys
could seldom escape. They scolded the Cat angrily
and shook the bars of their cage, but they could not
get out and the Cat only laughed at them.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="340" src="images/i229.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i229.jpg">
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>After the party had left the forest and were on the
plains of the Munchkin Country, it grew dark, and
they were obliged to make camp for the night, choosing
a pretty place beside a brook. By means of his
magic the Wizard created three tents, pitched in a row
on the grass and nicely fitted with all that was needful
for the comfort of his comrades. The middle tent was
for Dorothy and Trot, and had in it two cosy white
beds and two chairs. Another tent, also with beds
and chairs, was for the Wizard and Cap’n Bill, while
the third tent was for the Hungry Tiger, the Cowardly
Lion, the cage of Monkeys and the Glass Cat. Outside
the tents the Wizard made a fire and placed over it
a magic kettle from which he presently drew all sorts
of nice things for their supper, smoking hot.</p>
<p>After they had eaten and talked together for a
while under the twinkling stars, they all went to bed
and the people were soon asleep. The Lion and the
Tiger had almost fallen asleep, too, when they were
roused by the screams of the monkeys, for the Glass
Cat was pulling their tails again. Annoyed by the
uproar, the Hungry Tiger cried: “Stop that racket!”
and getting sight of the Glass Cat, he raised his big
paw and struck at the creature. The cat was quick
enough to dodge the blow, but the claws of the Hungry
Tiger scraped the monkeys’ cage and bent two
of the bars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="207" src="images/i231.jpg" width="599" id="img_images_i231.jpg">
</div>
<p>Then the Tiger lay down again to sleep, but the
monkeys soon discovered that the bending of the bars
would allow them to squeeze through. They did not
leave the cage, however, but after whispering
together they let their tails stick out and all remained
quiet. Presently the Glass Cat stole near the cage
again and gave a yank to one of the tails. Instantly
the monkeys leaped through the bars, one after
another, and although they were so small the entire
dozen of them surrounded the Glass Cat and clung to
her claws and tail and ears and made her a prisoner.
Then they forced her out of the tent and down to the
banks of the stream. The monkeys had noticed that
these banks were covered with thick, slimy mud of a
dark blue color, and when they had taken the Cat to
the stream, they smeared this mud all over the glass
body of the cat, filling the creature’s ears and eyes
with it, so that she could neither see nor hear. She
was no longer transparent and so thick was the mud
upon her that no one could see her pink brains or
her ruby heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>In this condition they led the pussy back to the
tent and then got inside their cage again.</p>
<p>By morning the mud had dried hard on the Glass
Cat and it was a dull blue color throughout. Dorothy
and Trot were horrified, but the Wizard shook his
head and said it served the Glass Cat right for teasing
the monkeys.</p>
<p>Cap’n Bill, with his strong hands, soon bent the
golden wires of the monkeys’ cage into the proper
position and then he asked the Wizard if he should
wash the Glass Cat in the water of the brook.</p>
<p>“Not just yet,” answered the Wizard. “The Cat
deserves to be punished, so I think I’ll leave that blue
mud—which is as bad as paint—upon her body until
she gets to the Emerald City. The silly creature is so
vain that she will be greatly shamed when the Oz
people see her in this condition, and perhaps she’ll
take the lesson to heart and leave the monkeys alone
hereafter.”</p>
<p>However, the Glass Cat could not see or hear, and to
avoid carrying her on the journey the Wizard picked
the mud out of her eyes and ears and Dorothy dampened
her handkerchief and washed both the eyes and
ears clean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>As soon as she could speak the Glass Cat asked
indignantly: “Aren’t you going to punish those
monkeys for playing such a trick on me?”</p>
<p>“No,” answered the Wizard. “You played a trick
on them by pulling their tails, so this is only tit-for-tat,
and I’m glad the monkeys had their revenge.”</p>
<p>He wouldn’t allow the Glass Cat to go near the
water, to wash herself, but made her follow them
when they resumed their journey toward the Emerald
City.</p>
<p>“This is only part of your punishment,” said the
Wizard, severely. “Ozma will laugh at you, when
we get to her palace, and so will the Scarecrow, and the
Tin Woodman, and Tik-Tok, and the Shaggy Man,
and Button-Bright, and the Patchwork Girl, and—”</p>
<p>“And the Pink Kitten,” added Dorothy.</p>
<p>That suggestion hurt the Glass Cat more than anything
else. The Pink Kitten always quarreled with
the Glass Cat and insisted that flesh was superior to
glass, while the Glass Cat would jeer at the Pink
Kitten, because it had no pink brains. But the pink
brains were all daubed with blue mud, just now,
and if the Pink Kitten should see the Glass Cat in
such a condition, it would be dreadfully humiliating.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>For several hours the Glass Cat walked along very
meekly, but toward noon it seized an opportunity
when no one was looking and darted away through
the long grass. It remembered that there was a tiny
lake of pure water near by, and to this lake the Cat
sped as fast as it could go.</p>
<p>The others never missed her until they stopped for
lunch, and then it was too late to hunt for her.</p>
<p>“I s’pect she’s gone somewhere to clean herself,”
said Dorothy.</p>
<p>“Never mind,” replied the Wizard. “Perhaps this
glass creature has been punished enough, and we
must not forget she saved both Trot and Cap’n Bill.”</p>
<p>“After first leading ’em onto an enchanted island,”
added Dorothy. “But I think, as you do, that the
Glass Cat is punished enough, and p’raps she won’t
try to pull the monkeys’ tails again.”</p>
<p>The Glass Cat did not rejoin the party of travelers.
She was still resentful, and they moved too slowly to
suit her, besides. When they arrived at the Royal
Palace, one of the first things they saw was the Glass
Cat curled up on a bench as bright and clean and
transparent as ever. But she pretended not to notice
them, and they passed her by without remark.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER 21</p>
<p>Dorothy and her friends arrived
at the Royal Palace at
an opportune time, for Ozma
was holding high court in her
Throne Room, where Professor
H. M. Wogglebug, T.E.,
was appealing to her to punish
some of the students of the
Royal Athletic College, of
which he was the Principal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>This College is located in
the Munchkin Country, but
not far from the Emerald
City. To enable the students to devote their entire
time to athletic exercises, such as boating, foot-ball,
and the like, Professor Wogglebug had invented an
assortment of Tablets of Learning. One of these
tablets, eaten by a scholar after breakfast, would
instantly enable him to understand arithmetic or
algebra or any other branch of mathematics. Another
tablet eaten after lunch gave a student a complete
knowledge of geography. Another tablet made it
possible for the eater to spell the most difficult words,
and still another enabled him to write a beautiful
hand. There were tablets for history, mechanics, home
cooking and agriculture, and it mattered not whether
a boy or a girl was stupid or bright, for the tablets
taught them everything in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>This method, which is patented in the Land of Oz
by Professor Wogglebug, saves paper and books, as
well as the tedious hours devoted to study in some of
our less favored schools, and it also allows the students
to devote all their time to racing, base-ball, tennis
and other manly and womanly sports, which are
greatly interfered with by study in those Temples
of Learning where Tablets of Learning are unknown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>But it so happened that Professor Wogglebug (who
had invented so much that he had acquired the habit)
carelessly invented a Square-Meal Tablet, which was
no bigger than your little finger-nail but contained, in
condensed form, the equal of a bowl of soup, a portion
of fried fish, a roast, a salad and a dessert, all of which
gave the same nourishment as a square meal.</p>
<p>The Professor was so proud of these Square-Meal
Tablets that he began to feed them to the students at
his college, instead of other food, but the boys and
girls objected because they wanted food that they
could enjoy the taste of. It was no fun at all to
swallow a tablet, with a glass of water, and call it a
dinner; so they refused to eat the Square-Meal
Tablets. Professor Wogglebug insisted, and the
result was that the Senior Class seized the learned
Professor one day and threw him into the river—clothes
and all. Everyone knows that a wogglebug
cannot swim, and so the inventor of the wonderful
Square-Meal Tablets lay helpless on the bottom of
the river for three days before a fisherman caught one
of his legs on a fishhook and dragged him out upon the
bank.</p>
<p>The learned Professor was naturally indignant at
such treatment, and so he brought the entire senior
class to the Emerald City and appealed to Ozma of Oz
to punish them for their rebellion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>I do not suppose the girl Ruler was very severe with
the rebellious boys and girls, because she had herself
refused to eat the Square-Meal Tablets in place of
food, but while she was listening to the interesting
case in her Throne Room, Cap’n Bill managed to
carry the golden flower-pot containing the Magic
Flower up to Trot’s room without it being seen by
anyone except Jellia Jamb, Ozma’s chief Maid of
Honor, and Jellia promised not to tell.</p>
<p>Also the Wizard was able to carry the cage of
monkeys up to one of the top towers of the palace,
where he had a room of his own, to which no one came
unless invited. So Trot and Dorothy and Cap’n Bill
and the Wizard were all delighted at the successful
end of their adventure. The Cowardly Lion and the
Hungry Tiger went to the marble stables behind the
Royal Palace, where they lived while at home, and
they too kept the secret, even refusing to tell the
Wooden Sawhorse, and Hank the Mule, and the Yellow
Hen, and the Pink Kitten where they had been.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Trot watered the Magic Flower every day and
allowed no one in her room to see the beautiful
blossoms except her friends, Betsy Bobbin and
Dorothy. The wonderful plant did not seem to lose
any of its magic by being removed from its island,
and Trot was sure that Ozma would prize it as one of
her most delightful treasures.</p>
<p>Up in his tower the little Wizard of Oz began
training his twelve tiny monkeys, and the little
creatures were so intelligent that they learned every
trick the Wizard tried to teach them. The Wizard
treated them with great kindness and gentleness and
gave them the food that monkeys love best, so they
promised to do their best on the great occasion of
Ozma’s birthday.</p>

</div>
<p class="center">CHAPTER 22</p>
<p>It seems odd that a fairy
should have a birthday, for
fairies, they say, were born at
the beginning of time and live
forever. Yet, on the other
hand, it would be a shame to
deprive a fairy, who has so
many other good things, of
the delights of a birthday. So
we need not wonder that the
fairies keep their birthdays
just as other folks do, and
consider them occasions for feasting and rejoicing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Ozma, the beautiful girl Ruler of the Fairyland of
Oz, was a real fairy, and so sweet and gentle in caring
for her people that she was greatly beloved by them
all. She lived in the most magnificent palace in the
most magnificent city in the world, but that did not
prevent her from being the friend of the most humble
person in her dominions. She would mount her
wooden Sawhorse, and ride out to a farm house and sit
in the kitchen to talk with the good wife of the farmer
while she did her family baking; or she would play
with the children and give them rides on her famous
wooden steed; or she would stop in a forest to speak to
a charcoal burner and ask if he was happy or desired
anything to make him more content; or she would teach
young girls how to sew and plan pretty dresses, or
enter the shops where the jewelers and craftsmen were
busy and watch them at their work, giving to each and
all a cheering word or sunny smile.</p>
<p>And then Ozma would sit in her jeweled throne, with
her chosen courtiers all about her, and listen patiently
to any complaint brought to her by her subjects,
striving to accord equal justice to all. Knowing she
was fair in her decisions, the Oz people never
murmured at her judgments, but agreed, if Ozma
decided against them, she was right and they wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>When Dorothy and Trot and Betsy Bobbin and Ozma
were together, one would think they were all about of
an age, and the fairy Ruler no older and no more
“grown up” than the other three. She would laugh
and romp with them in regular girlish fashion, yet
there was an air of quiet dignity about Ozma, even in
her merriest moods, that, in a manner, distinguished
her from the others. The three girls loved her
devotedly, but they were never able to quite forget
that Ozma was the Royal Ruler of the wonderful fairyland
of Oz, and by birth belonged to a powerful race.</p>
<p>Ozma’s palace stood in the center of a delightful
and extensive garden, where splendid trees and
flowering shrubs and statuary and fountains
abounded. One could walk for hours in this fascinating
park and see something interesting at every step.
In one place was an aquarium, where strange and
beautiful fish swam; at another spot all the birds of
the air gathered daily to a great feast which Ozma’s
servants provided for them, and were so fearless of
harm that they would alight upon one’s shoulders and
eat from one’s hand. There was also the Fountain of
the Water of Oblivion, but it was dangerous to drink
of this water, because it made one forget everything
he had ever before known, even to his own name, and
therefore Ozma had placed a sign of warning upon the
fountain. But there were also fountains that were
delightfully perfumed, and fountains of delicious nectar,
cool and richly flavored, where all were welcome
to refresh themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="695" src="images/i243.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i243.jpg">
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>Around the palace grounds was a great wall, thickly
encrusted with glittering emeralds, but the gates stood
open and no one was forbidden entrance. On holidays
the people of the Emerald City often took their children
to see the wonders of Ozma’s gardens, and even
entered the Royal Palace, if they felt so inclined, for
they knew that they and their Ruler were friends, and
that Ozma delighted to give them pleasure.</p>
<p>When all this is considered, you will not be surprised
that the people throughout the Land of Oz, as well as
Ozma’s most intimate friends and her royal courtiers,
were eager to celebrate her birthday, and made preparations
for the festival weeks in advance. All the brass
bands practiced their nicest tunes, for they were to
march in the numerous processions to be made in the
Winkie Country, the Gillikin Country, the Munchkin
Country and the Quadling Country, as well as in the
Emerald City. Not all the people could go to congratulate
their Ruler, but all could celebrate her birthday,
in one way or another, however far distant from
her palace they might be. Every home and building
throughout the Land of Oz was to be decorated with
banners and bunting, and there were to be games, and
plays, and a general good time for every one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>It was Ozma’s custom on her birthday to give a
grand feast at the palace, to which all her closest
friends were invited. It was a queerly assorted company,
indeed, for there are more quaint and unusual
characters in Oz than in all the rest of the world, and
Ozma was more interested in unusual people than in
ordinary ones—just as you and I are.</p>
<p>On this especial birthday of the lovely girl Ruler, a
long table was set in the royal Banquet Hall of the
palace, at which were place-cards for the invited
guests, and at one end of the great room was a smaller
table, not so high, for Ozma’s animal friends, whom
she never forgot, and at the other end was a big table
where all of the birthday gifts were to be arranged.</p>
<p>When the guests arrived, they placed their gifts on
this table and then found their places at the banquet
table. And, after the guests were all placed, the animals
entered in a solemn procession and were placed
at their table by Jellia Jamb. Then, while an orchestra
hidden by a bank of roses and ferns played a march
composed for the occasion, the Royal Ozma entered
the Banquet Hall, attended by her Maids of Honor,
and took her seat at the head of the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="686" src="images/i246.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i246.jpg">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>She was greeted by a cheer from all the assembled
company, the animals adding their roars and growls
and barks and mewing and cackling to swell the glad
tumult, and then all seated themselves at their tables.</p>
<p>At Ozma’s right sat the famous Scarecrow of Oz,
whose straw-stuffed body was not beautiful, but whose
happy nature and shrewd wit had made him a general
favorite. On the left of the Ruler was placed the Tin
Woodman, whose metal body had been brightly polished
for this event. The Tin Woodman was the Emperor
of the Winkie Country and one of the most
important persons in Oz.</p>
<p>Next to the Scarecrow, Dorothy was seated, and next
to her was Tik-Tok, the Clockwork Man, who had been
wound up as tightly as his clockwork would permit, so
he wouldn’t interrupt the festivities by running down.
Then came Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, Dorothy’s own
relations, two kindly old people who had a cozy home
in the Emerald City and were very happy and contented
there. Then Betsy Bobbin was seated, and next
to her the droll and delightful Shaggy Man, who was a
favorite wherever he went.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>On the other side of the table, opposite the Tin
Woodman was placed Trot, and next to her, Cap’n Bill.
Then was seated Button Bright and Ojo the Lucky,
and Dr. Pipt and his good wife Margalot, and the
astonishing Frogman, who had come from the Yip
country to be present at Ozma’s birthday feast.</p>
<p>At the foot of the table, facing Ozma, was seated the
queenly Glinda, the good Sorceress of Oz, for this was
really the place of honor next to the head of the table
where Ozma herself sat. On Glinda’s right was the
Little Wizard of Oz, who owed to Glinda all of the
magical arts he knew. Then came Jinjur, a pretty
girl farmer of whom Ozma and Dorothy were quite
fond. The adjoining seat was occupied by the Tin
Soldier, and next to him was Professor H. M. Wogglebug,
T.E., of the Royal Athletic College.</p>
<p>On Glinda’s left was placed the jolly Patchwork
Girl, who was a little afraid of the Sorceress and so
was likely to behave herself pretty well. The Shaggy
Man’s brother was beside the Patchwork Girl, and
then came that interesting personage, Jack Pumpkinhead,
who had grown a splendid big pumpkin for a
new head to be worn on Ozma’s birthday, and had
carved a face on it that was even jollier in expression
than the one he had last worn. New heads were not
unusual with Jack, for the pumpkins did not keep
long, and when the seeds—which served him as
brains—began to get soft and mushy, he realized his
head would soon spoil, and so he procured a new one
from his great field of pumpkins—grown by him so
that he need never lack a head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>You will have noticed that the company at Ozma’s
banquet table was somewhat mixed, but every one
invited was a tried and trusted friend of the girl
Ruler, and their presence made her quite happy.</p>
<p>No sooner had Ozma seated herself, with her back
to the birthday table, than she noticed that all present
were eyeing with curiosity and pleasure something
behind her, for the gorgeous Magic Flower was blooming
gloriously and the mammoth blossoms that quickly
succeeded one another on the plant were beautiful to
view and filled the entire room with their delicate
fragrance. Ozma wanted to look, too, to see what all
were staring at, but she controlled her curiosity because
it was not proper that she should yet view her
birthday gifts.</p>
<p>So the sweet and lovely Ruler devoted herself to
her guests, several of whom, as the Sorcerer, the Tin
Woodman, the Patchwork Girl, Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead
and the Tin Soldier, never ate anything but
sat very politely in their places and tried to entertain
those of the guests who did eat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>And, at the animal table, there was another interesting
group, consisting of the Cowardly Lion, the
Hungry Tiger, Toto—Dorothy’s little shaggy black dog—Hank
the Mule, the Pink Kitten, the Wooden Sawhorse,
the Yellow Hen, and the Glass Cat. All of these
had good appetites except the Sawhorse and the Glass
Cat, and each was given a plentiful supply of the food
it liked best.</p>
<p>Finally, when the banquet was nearly over and the
ice-cream was to be served, four servants entered
bearing a huge cake, all frosted and decorated with
candy flowers. Around the edge of the cake was a
row of lighted candles, and in the center were raised
candy letters that spelled the words:</p>
<p class="center">OZMA’S
<br>Birthday Cake
<br>from
<br>Dorothy and the Wizard</p>
<p>“Oh, how beautiful!” cried Ozma, greatly delighted,
and Dorothy said eagerly: “Now you must cut the
cake, Ozma, and each of us will eat a piece with our
ice-cream.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>Jellia Jamb brought a large golden knife with a
jeweled handle, and Ozma stood up in her place and
attempted to cut the cake. But as soon as the frosting
in the center broke under the pressure of the knife
there leaped from the cake a tiny monkey three
inches high, and he was followed by another and another,
until twelve monkeys stood on the tablecloth
and bowed low to Ozma.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to our gracious Ruler!” they exclaimed
in a chorus, and then they began a dance, so
droll and amusing that all the company roared with
laughter and even Ozma joined in the merriment.
But after the dance the monkeys performed some
wonderful acrobatic feats, and then they ran to the
hollow of the cake and took out some band instruments
of burnished gold—cornets, horns, drums, and
the like—and forming into a procession the monkeys
marched up and down the table playing a jolly tune
with the ease of skilled musicians.</p>
<p>Dorothy was delighted with the success of her “Surprise
Cake,” and after the monkeys had finished their
performance, the banquet came to an end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="694" src="images/i253.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i253.jpg">
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>Now was the time for Ozma to see her other presents,
so Glinda the Good rose and, taking the girl
Ruler by her hand, led her to the table where all her
gifts were placed in magnificent array. The Magic
Flower of course attracted her attention first, and Trot
had to tell her the whole story of their adventures in
getting it. The little girl did not forget to give due
credit to the Glass Cat and the little Wizard, but it
was really Cap’n Bill who bravely carried the golden
flowerpot away from the enchanted Isle.</p>
<p>Ozma thanked them all, and said she would place
the Magic Flower in her boudoir where she might
enjoy its beauty and fragrance continually. But now
she discovered the marvelous gown woven by Glinda
and her maidens from strands drawn from pure emeralds,
and being a girl who loved pretty clothes, Ozma’s
ecstasy at being presented with this exquisite gown
may well be imagined. She could hardly wait to put
it on, but the table was loaded with other pretty gifts
and the night was far spent before the happy girl
Ruler had examined all her presents and thanked
those who had lovingly donated them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<h2 id="c23">The Fountain of Oblivion</h2>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="677" src="images/i255.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i255.jpg">
</div>
<p class="center">CHAPTER 23</p>
<p>The morning after the birthday
fete, as the Wizard and
Dorothy were walking in the
grounds of the palace, Ozma
came out and joined them,
saying:</p>
<p>“I want to hear more of
your adventures in the Forest
of Gugu, and how you were
able to get those dear little
monkeys to use in Dorothy’s
Surprise Cake.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>So they sat down on a marble
bench near to the fountain of the Water of Oblivion,
and between them Dorothy and the Wizard
related their adventures.</p>
<p>“I was dreadfully fussy while I was a woolly
lamb,” said Dorothy, “for it didn’t feel good, a bit.
And I wasn’t quite sure, you know, that I’d ever get
to be a girl again.”</p>
<p>“You might have been a woolly lamb yet, if I
hadn’t happened to have discovered that Magic Transformation
Word,” declared the Wizard.</p>
<p>“But what became of the walnut and the hickory-nut
into which you transformed those dreadful beast
magicians?” inquired Ozma.</p>
<p>“Why, I’d almost forgotten them,” was the reply;
“but I believe they are still here in my pocket.”</p>
<p>Then he searched in his pockets and brought out
the two nuts and showed them to her.</p>
<p>Ozma regarded them thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“It isn’t right to leave any living creatures in such
helpless forms,” said she. “I think, Wizard, you
ought to transform them into their natural shapes
again.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>“But I don’t know what their natural shapes are,”
he objected, “for of course the forms of mixed animals
which they had assumed were not natural to
them. And you must not forget, Ozma, that their
natures were cruel and mischievous, so if I bring
them back to life they might cause us a great deal
of trouble.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless,” said the Ruler of Oz, “we must
free them from their present enchantments. When
you restore them to their natural forms we will discover
who they really are, and surely we need not
fear any two people, even though they prove to be
magicians and our enemies.”</p>
<p>“I am not so sure of that,” protested the Wizard,
with a shake of his bald head. “The one bit of magic
I robbed them of—which was the word of transformation—is
so simple, yet so powerful, that neither
Glinda nor I can equal it. It isn’t all in the word,
you know, it’s the way the word is pronounced. So
if the two strange magicians have other magic of the
same sort, they might prove very dangerous to us, if
we liberated them.”</p>
<p>“I’ve an idea!” exclaimed Dorothy. “I’m no wizard,
and no fairy, but if you do as I say, we needn’t
fear these people at all.”</p>
<p>“What is your thought, my dear?” asked Ozma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>“Well,” replied the girl, “here is this fountain of
the Water of Oblivion, and that’s what put the notion
into my head. When the Wizard speaks that ter’ble
word that will change ’em back to their real forms, he
can make ’em dreadful thirsty, too, and we’ll put a
cup right here by the fountain, so it’ll be handy. Then
they’ll drink the water and forget all the magic they
ever knew—and everything else, too.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a bad idea,” said the Wizard, looking
at Dorothy approvingly.</p>
<p>“It’s a very <i>good</i> idea,” declared Ozma. “Run for
a cup, Dorothy.”</p>
<p>So Dorothy ran to get a cup, and while she was
gone the Wizard said:</p>
<p>“I don’t know whether the real forms of these
magicians are those of men or beasts. If they’re
beasts, they would not drink from a cup but might
attack us at once and drink afterward. So it might
be safer for us to have the Cowardly Lion and the
Hungry Tiger here to protect us if necessary.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>Ozma drew out a silver whistle which was attached
to a slender gold chain and blew upon the whistle
two shrill blasts. The sound, though not harsh, was
very penetrating, and as soon as it reached the ears
of the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, the two
huge beasts quickly came bounding toward them.
Ozma explained to them what the Wizard was about
to do, and told them to keep quiet unless danger
threatened. So the two powerful guardians of the
Ruler of Oz crouched beside the fountain and waited.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="341" src="images/i259.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i259.jpg">
</div>
<p>Dorothy returned and set the cup on the edge of
the fountain. Then the Wizard placed the hickory-nut
beside the fountain and said in a solemn voice:</p>
<p>“I want you to resume your natural form, and to
be very thirsty—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>In an instant there appeared, in the place of the
hickory-nut, the form of Kiki Aru, the Hyup boy. He
seemed bewildered, at first, as if trying to remember
what had happened to him and why he was in this
strange place. But he was facing the fountain, and
the bubbling water reminded him that he was thirsty.
Without noticing Ozma, the Wizard and Dorothy, who
were behind him, he picked up the cup, filled it with
the Water of Oblivion, and drank it to the last drop.</p>
<p>He was now no longer thirsty, but he felt more bewildered
than ever, for now he could remember nothing
at all—not even his name or where he came
from. He looked around the beautiful garden with
a pleased expression, and then, turning, he beheld
Ozma and the Wizard and Dorothy regarding him curiously
and the two great beasts crouching behind them.</p>
<p>Kiki Aru did not know who they were, but he
thought Ozma very lovely and Dorothy very pleasant.
So he smiled at them—the same innocent, happy
smile that a baby might have indulged in, and that
pleased Dorothy, who seized his hand and led him to
a seat beside her on the bench.</p>
<p>“Why, I thought you were a dreadful magician,”
she exclaimed, “and you’re only a boy!”</p>
<p>“What is a magician?” he asked, “and what is a
boy?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know?” inquired the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>Kiki shook his head. Then he laughed.</p>
<p>“I do not seem to know anything,” he replied.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="343" src="images/i261.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i261.jpg">
</div>
<p>“It’s very curious,” remarked the Wizard. “He
wears the dress of the Munchkins, so he must have
lived at one time in the Munchkin Country. Of
course the boy can tell us nothing of his history or
his family, for he has forgotten all that he ever knew.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>“He seems a nice boy, now that all the wickedness
has gone from him,” said Ozma. “So we will keep
him here with us and teach him our ways—to be
true and considerate of others.”</p>
<p>“Why, in that case, it’s lucky for him he drank the
Water of Oblivion,” said Dorothy.</p>
<p>“It is indeed,” agreed the Wizard. “But the remarkable
thing, to me, is how such a young boy ever
learned the secret of the Magic Word of Transformation.
Perhaps his companion, who is at present this
walnut, was the real magician, although I seem to
remember that it was this boy in the beast’s form
who whispered the Magic Word into the hollow tree,
where I overheard it.”</p>
<p>“Well, we will soon know who the other is,” suggested
Ozma. “He may prove to be another Munchkin
boy.”</p>
<p>The Wizard placed the walnut near the fountain
and said, as slowly and solemnly as before:</p>
<p>“I want you to resume your natural form, and to
be very thirsty—<span class="gs">Pyrzqxgl</span>!”</p>
<p>Then the walnut disappeared and Ruggedo the
Nome stood in its place. He also was facing the
fountain, and he reached for the cup, filled it, and
was about to drink when Dorothy exclaimed:</p>
<p>“Why, it’s the old Nome King!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>Ruggedo swung around and faced them, the cup
still in his hand.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="318" src="images/i263.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i263.jpg">
</div>
<p>“Yes,” he said in an angry voice, “it’s the old Nome
King, and I’m going to conquer all Oz and be revenged
on you for kicking me out of my throne.” He
looked around a moment, and then continued: “There
isn’t an egg in sight, and I’m stronger than all of you
people put together! I don’t know how I came here,
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
but I’m going to fight the fight of my life—and I’ll
win!”</p>
<p>His long white hair and beard waved in the breeze;
his eyes flashed hate and vengeance, and so astonished
and shocked were they by the sudden appearance of
this old enemy of the Oz people that they could only
stare at him in silence and shrink away from his
wild glare.</p>
<p>Ruggedo laughed. He drank the water, threw the
cup on the ground and said fiercely:</p>
<p>“And now—and now—and—”</p>
<p>His voice grew gentle. He rubbed his forehead
with a puzzled air and stroked his long beard.</p>
<p>“What was I going to say?” he asked, pleadingly.</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember?” said the Wizard.</p>
<p>“No; I’ve forgotten.”</p>
<p>“Who <i>are</i> you?” asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>He tried to think. “I—I’m sure I don’t know,”
he stammered.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know who <i>we</i> are, either?” questioned
the girl.</p>
<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Nome.</p>
<p>“Tell us who this Munchkin boy is,” suggested
Ozma.</p>
<p>Ruggedo looked at the boy and shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>“He’s a stranger to me. You are all strangers. I—I’m
a stranger to myself,” he said.</p>
<p>Then he patted the Lion’s head and murmured,
“Good doggie!” and the Lion growled indignantly.</p>
<div class="img">
<img alt="" height="311" src="images/i265.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i265.jpg">
</div>
<p>“What shall we do with him?” asked the Wizard,
perplexed.</p>
<p>“Once before the wicked old Nome came here to
conquer us, and then, as now, he drank of the Water
of Oblivion and became harmless. But we sent him
back to the Nome Kingdom, where he soon learned
the old evil ways again.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>“For that reason,” said Ozma, “we must find a place
for him in the Land of Oz, and keep him here. For
here he can learn no evil and will always be as innocent
of guile as our own people.”</p>
<p>And so the wandering ex-King of the Nomes found
a new home, a peaceful and happy home, where he
was quite content and passed his days in innocent
enjoyment.</p>

<h2><span class="large"><i>The Oz Books</i></span>
<br><span class="smallest">BY</span>
<br>L. FRANK BAUM
<br><span class="smaller">“Royal Historian of Oz”</span></h2>
<h3 class="biblio"><i>The Wizard of Oz</i>
<br><span class="smaller">[Originally published as <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>]</span></h3>
<p class="biblio">It is in this book that Oz is “discovered.” A little Kansas girl—Dorothy
Gale—is carried in her house to Oz when a cyclone whisks it through
the sky. As the house lands in the Munchkin Country (one of the four great
countries of Oz) it destroys a wicked witch and sends Dorothy off on her first
adventure in Oz. She finds the Scarecrow, meets the Tin Woodman and the
Cowardly Lion, melts a second wicked witch with a pail of water and finds her
way home. Since this book appeared a half-century ago, we have learned many
marvelous things about the Land of Oz.</p>
<h3 class="biblio"><i>The Land of Oz</i>
<br><span class="smaller">[Originally published as <i>The Marvelous Land of Oz</i>]</span></h3>
<p class="biblio">This sequel to <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> deals entirely with the early
history of Oz. No one from the United States or any other part of the “great
outside world” appears in it. It takes its readers on a series of incredible adventures
with Tip, a small boy who runs away from old Mombi, the witch, taking
with him Jack Pumpkinhead and the wooden Saw-Horse. The Scarecrow is King
of the Emerald City until he, Tip, Jack, and the Tin Woodman are forced to
flee the royal palace when it is invaded by General Jinjur and her army of rebelling
girls. <i>The Land of Oz</i> ends with an amazing surprise, and from that
moment on Ozma is princess of all Oz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>Ozma of Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">Few of the Oz books are as crowded with exciting Oz happenings
as this one. Not only does it bring Dorothy back to Oz on her second visit,
but it introduces Dorothy to Ozma, relates Ozma’s first important adventure,
and introduces for the first time such famous Oz characters as Tik-Tok, the mechanical
man, Billina the hen, the Hungry Tiger, and—<i>the Nome King</i>! Most
of the adventures in this book take place outside Oz, in the Land of Ev and
the Nome Kingdom. Scarcely a page fails to quiver with excitement, magic and
adventure.</p>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">Of course, everyone always predicted it would happen! And in
this book it does—the Wizard comes back to Oz to stay. Best of all, he comes
with Dorothy, who is having adventure number three that leads her to Oz, this
time via a California earthquake. In this book we meet Dorothy’s pink kitten,
Eureka, whose manners need adjusting badly, and two good friends who we
are sorry did not remain in Oz—Jim the cabhorse, and Zeb, Dorothy’s young
cousin, who works on a ranch as a hired boy.</p>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>The Road to Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">We like to think of this volume as “The Party Book of Oz.”
Almost everyone loves a party, and when Ozma has a birthday party with
notables from every part of fairyland attending—well! It is just like attending
Ozma’s party in person. You meet the famous of Oz, and lots of others, such as
Queen Zixi of Ix, John Dough, Chick the Cherub, the Queen of Merryland, Para
Bruin the rubber bear and—best of all—Santa Claus himself! Of course there
are lots of adventures on that famous road to Oz before the party, during which
Dorothy, on her way to Oz for the fourth time, meets such heart-warming characters
as the Shaggy Man, Button-Bright, and lovely Polychrome, daughter of
the rainbow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>The Emerald City of Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">Here is a “double” story of Oz. While Dorothy, her Aunt Em
and Uncle Henry experience the events that lead to their going to Oz to make
their home in the Emerald City, the wicked Nome King is plotting to conquer
Oz and enslave its people. Later we go with Dorothy and her friends in the
Red Wagon on a grand tour of Oz that is simply packed with excitement and
events. While this transpires, we learn also of the Nome King’s elaborate preparations
to conquer Oz. As Dorothy and her friends return to the Emerald City,
the Nome King and his hordes of warriors are about to invade it. How Oz is
saved is an ending that will amaze and delight you.</p>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>The Patchwork Girl of Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">Here, the Patchwork Girl is brought to life by Dr. Pipt’s magic
Powder of Life. From that moment on the action never slows down in this
exciting book. It tells of Ojo’s quest for the strange ingredients necessary to
brew a magic liquid that will release his Unk Nunkie from a spell—the spell
cast by the Liquid of Petrefaction, which has turned him into a marble statue.
In addition to the Patchwork Girl, Ojo and Unk Nunkie, this book introduces
those famous Oz creatures, the Woozy, and Bungle the glass cat. Oz certainly
has become a merrier, happier land since the Patchwork Girl came to life, and
this is the book that tells how Scraps came to be made, how she was brought
to life, and all about her early adventures.</p>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>Tik-Tok of Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">For the second time a little girl from the United States comes
to Oz. Betsy Bobbin is shipwrecked in the Nonestic Ocean with her friend Hank
the mule. The two drift to shore in the Rose Kingdom on a fragment of wreckage.
Betsy meets the Shaggy Man and accompanies him to the Nome Kingdom,
where Shaggy hopes to release his brother, a prisoner of the Nome King. On
their way to the Nome Kingdom, one fascinating adventure follows another.
They meet Queen Ann Soforth of Oogaboo and her army, and lovely Polychrome,
who had lost her rainbow again; they rescue Tik-Tok from a well; and
are dropped through a Hollow Tube to the other side of the world where they
meet Quox, the dragon. You’ll find it one of the most exciting of all the Oz books.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>The Scarecrow of Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">This is the Oz book which L. Frank Baum considered his best.
It starts quietly enough with Trot and Cap’n Bill rowing along a shore of the
Pacific Ocean to visit one of the many caves near their home on the California
coast. Suddenly, a mighty whirlpool engulfs them. The old sailorman and the
little girl are miraculously saved and regain consciousness to find themselves in
a sea cavern. (To this day, Trot asserts she felt mermaid arms about her during
those terrible moments under water.) From here on, one perilous adventure
crowds in upon another. In Jinxland they meet the Scarecrow who takes charge
of things once Cap’n Bill is transformed into a tiny grasshopper with a wooden
leg. An exciting royal reception greets the adventurers upon their return to the
Emerald City.</p>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>Rinkitink in Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">Prince Inga of Pingaree is the boy hero of this fine story of
peril-filled adventure in the islands of the Nonestic Ocean. King Rinkitink provides
comic relief, and by the time you reach the final page you will love this
fat, jolly little king. Bilbil the goat, with his surly disposition, provides a fine
contrast to Rinkitink’s merriment and Prince Inga’s bravery and courage in the
face of danger. Some may say that the three magic pearls are the real heroes
of this story, but the pearls would have been of little use to King Kitticut and
Queen Garee if Prince Inga hadn’t used them wisely and courageously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>The Lost Princess of Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">Talk about <i>Button-Bright</i> getting lost—<i>Ozma</i> is almost as bad!
This is actually the second time Ozma has been lost. As you know, once she was
“lost” for many years. But in this book she is lost for only a short time. As soon
as it is discovered that the ruler of Oz is lost—and with her all the important
magical instruments in Oz—search parties, one for each of the four countries
of Oz, set out to find her. We follow the adventures of the party headed by
Dorothy and the Wizard, who explore unknown parts of the Winkie Country in
search of Ozma. How Ozma is found, and where she has been, will surprise you.
Frogman, a new character, is introduced in this book.</p>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>The Tin Woodman of Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">Woot the Wanderer causes this chapter of Oz history to transpire.
When Woot wanders into the splendid tin castle of Nick Chopper, the Tin
Woodman and Emperor of the Winkies, he meets the Scarecrow, who is visiting
his old friend. The Tin Woodman tells Woot the story of how he had once been
a flesh-and-blood woodman in love with a maiden named Nimmie Aimee. Woot
suggests that since the Tin Woodman now has a kind and loving heart, it is his
duty to find Nimmie Aimee and make her Empress of the Winkies. The Scarecrow
agrees, so the three set off to search for the girl. No less surprising than the
adventures encountered on the journey is Nimmie Aimee’s reception of her
former suitor.</p>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>The Magic of Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">Old Ruggedo, the former Nome King, comes to Oz for the
second time, and makes more trouble than he did on his first visit. Ruggedo
never gives up the idea of conquering Oz, and this time he has the advantage
of being in the country without Ozma’s knowledge. Also, he has the magic and
somewhat grudging help of Kiki Aru, the Munchkin boy who is illegally practicing
the art. If you like magic, then this is a book for you. There’s magic on
every page, and everyone in the story eventually is transformed into something
else, or bewitched in one way or another. Even the wild animals in the great
Forest of Gugu do not escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<h3 class="biblio"> <i>Glinda of Oz</i></h3>
<p class="biblio">This is the last Oz book written by L. Frank Baum. It is one of
the best in the series, with Dorothy, Ozma, and Glinda in an adventure that
takes them to an amazing crystal-domed city on an enchanted island. This island
is situated in a lake in the Gillikin Country. Ozma and Glinda are confronted
by powerful magic and determined enemies. For a time Dorothy and Ozma
are prisoners in the crystal-domed city which is able to submerge below the
surface of the lake. Few of the Oz books equal this one in suspense and mystery—a
story that is truly “out of this world.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
