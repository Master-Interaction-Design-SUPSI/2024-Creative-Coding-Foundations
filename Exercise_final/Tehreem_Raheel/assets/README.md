## Concept Description

Driving from my Henna passion. I kind of created my own personal webpage. A creative outlet where users can design and customize henna patterns and also learn about various traditional henna styles, such as Indian, Moroccan, and Egyptian, with their historical and cultural significance. It offers an interactive experience where users can learn in-depth about the design elements, apply and cutomize them on the virtual hand. This digital canvas allows for real-time modifications, from adjusting the intricacy of the patterns to changing the style and rotation of design elements, making it a dynamic tool for both learning and expression. My purpose was to educate the modern day henna artists about the original design elements and their meanings so they are not there just to be pretty but also holds a meaning behind and don't loose the true essence of traditional henna.
