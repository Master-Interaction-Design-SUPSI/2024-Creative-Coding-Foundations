## Concept description
Prototypo is an interactive tool that bridges the physical and digital worlds to explore typography dynamically. At its core is a custom-built transparent box housing an Arduino board and connected components, showcasing the circuitry and hardware inside. This physical interface is brought to life by the code, which translates sensor inputs, button presses, and switches into real-time typographic transformations. Through creative coding, users can manipulate font size, weight, style, and family, guided by labels and typography on the box's exterior. *ProtoType* demonstrates the powerful synergy between code and hardware, turning typographic design into an engaging, hands-on experience.
