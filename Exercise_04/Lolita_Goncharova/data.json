As the personification of the Buddha’s cranial bump <em>(ushnisha),</em> Ushnishavijaya is associated with wisdom and is worshipped for long life and freedom from rebirth. At the periphery, she is surrounded by the guardians of the four directions. The blank red spaces are areas where the painting was damaged and then restored. An upper section is also missing. The many small <em>chaityas</em> represent the multiplication of merit accumulated in this painting, which symbolically allow for the donation of 100,000 <em>chaityas</em> in a ceremony known as <em>lakshachaitya</em> (100,000 <em>chaityas</em>). This ceremony is depicted in the bottom register, where priests officiate at the lower left and donors officiate at the lower right.</p>\n",

He relocated to Chicago in 1967 to study first sculpture, then photography, at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. As a boy in Havana, Medina had, as he put it, “explored the brightest and darkest corners of that city . . . in search of ineffable essences, contradictions, and tragedies contained in anything human.” This interest in his immediate surroundings continued in Chicago, where he turned to the territorial gang graffiti he found in his own neighborhood northwest of Wrigley Field. Medina approached these images as an archivist and as someone familiar with power struggles, photographing several walls after gang members had swung cans of white paint at them to efface a rival gang’s graffiti. He eventually gained the trust of members of several Latino gangs, who allowed him to take their portraits in front of their graffiti, in a further gesture of power and defiance.</p>\n",

Sengstacke</a> created photographic assemblages for exhibitions at spaces such as the South Side Community Arts Center. This assemblage focuses on the work of the Zambezi Art Guild, which was founded in 1966 by artist Nii Oti (born Timothy Williams) on Chicago’s South Side. The guild was created to encourage pride in Black history and expose local residents to crafts that reflect Africa’s rich cultural heritage. Oti ran several storefront operations on the South Side, one of which is seen at center. Sengstacke’s collage depicts exhibitions, examples of the guild’s crafts, and members at work. This range of images and the collage format emphasize unity and community pride—driving forces behind the many artistic collectives that emerged at the height of Chicago’s Black Arts Movement.</p>\n",

He relocated to Chicago in 1967 to study first sculpture, then photography, at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. As a boy in Havana, Medina had, as he put it, “explored the brightest and darkest corners of that city . . . in search of ineffable essences, contradictions, and tragedies contained in anything human.” This interest in his immediate surroundings continued in Chicago, where he turned to the territorial gang graffiti he found in his own neighborhood northwest of Wrigley Field. Medina approached these images as an archivist and as someone familiar with power struggles, photographing several walls after gang members had swung cans of white paint at them to efface a rival gang’s graffiti. He eventually gained the trust of members of several Latino gangs, who allowed him to take their portraits in front of their graffiti, in a further gesture of power and defiance.</p>\n",

He relocated to Chicago in 1967 to study first sculpture, then photography, at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. As a boy in Havana, Medina had, as he put it, “explored the brightest and darkest corners of that city . . . in search of ineffable essences, contradictions, and tragedies contained in anything human.” This interest in his immediate surroundings continued in Chicago, where he turned to the territorial gang graffiti he found in his own neighborhood northwest of Wrigley Field. Medina approached these images as an archivist and as someone familiar with power struggles, photographing several walls after gang members had swung cans of white paint at them to efface a rival gang’s graffiti. He eventually gained the trust of members of several Latino gangs, who allowed him to take their portraits in front of their graffiti, in a further gesture of power and defiance.</p>\n",
