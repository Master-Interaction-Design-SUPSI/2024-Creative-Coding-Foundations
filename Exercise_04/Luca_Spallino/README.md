# Rover Roll

## Luca Enrico Spallino

## Concept description

From NASA's API, I was able to extract data collected by the Curiosity rover during its years of work on Mars.

The user can generate an image from the thousands taken by Curiosity, and by clicking on the generated image, they can discover specific details about that photograph. The rover itself will explain to the user when and how that particular image was captured.
