# Audio Visualizer

## Antonia Siran

### 
The Audio Visualizer captures audio input from your microphone, processes the frequency data, and visualizes it as either a circle or a square, which respond to the volume and frequency of the audio. The visualizations dynamically change their colors and sizes, providing an engaging, real-time audio-visual experience.
