# MineField
## AmaÃ«l Cacciola 
### The game is inspired by the minefield, an old windows game, you can move in any direction if you have squares around, jump a square with space and have the possibility to see the path you took the first time when you got it wrong, so you know where you can and cannot pass. The game only starts again if you get to the end square.
